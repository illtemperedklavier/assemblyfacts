<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para210"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong>
 Ms. Khanjin has moved government notice of motion number 77. I’ve been

June 18,” and it says what?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para211"><strong>The Deputy Clerk (Mr. Trevor Day):</strong> “Thursday, June 17.”</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para212"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> It says, “Thursday, June 17.” It should actually be the 18th. The Thursday is June 18, not the 17th.</span></p>

<p><span id="para213">Further debate? I recognize again the member for Barrie–Innisfil.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para214"><strong>Ms. Andrea Khanjin:</strong>
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As you see by this motion, when our government 
got elected, we hit the ground running to accomplish so much for 
Ontarians. When I was knocking on doors and talking to many of my 
constituents, they often said, “What does the government really do for 
us? How can they achieve progress? We see a lot of debate, we see a lot 
of bickering, and we see a lot of things in the debate. What about grand
 achievements and really delivering on promises?”</span></p>

<p><span id="para215">You often heard from us, “Promises made, promises 
kept,” and that comes with great feedback. I know that the residents of 
Barrie–Innisfil, especially during this time of COVID-19, have really 
praised this government for some of the economic achievements we have 
achieved, because we’re in a better position to weather the storm.</span></p>

<p><span id="para216">Of course this is a health pandemic—and I want to,
 of course, thank all the front-line workers for all their efforts, 
whether it be Stevenson Memorial or whether it be Royal Victoria 
Hospital or Southlake—all hospitals that are very close to my riding. 
They’ve been doing incredible work. I just think of a lot of the 
retirement homes and long-term-care homes with a lot of their nurses and
 their PSWs who are doing so much work.</span></p>

<p><span id="para217">It’s one of the reasons that, on personal support 
worker appreciation day locally, I had launched a recognition award for 
the community to get involved, where they can nominate their 
local—whether it’s a nurse or whether it’s a personal support worker—to 
nominate to recognize them for what they’re doing today, because they’re
 working really hard. We need to respect that and do our part as well, 
and to keep plugging away and working through the summer. We really owe 
it to all Ontarians. We owe it to those who are keeping us safe and we 
owe it to the taxpaying residents of this province.</span></p>

<p><span id="para218">When you talk to nurses who are working day in and
 day out—we’re talking about sitting for a few hours a day, not even 
going into midnight, not even going to 4 a.m. But some of these 
nurses—and I want to thank many of them. One of them is a good friend of
 mine, Andrea Logan. She has been working, day in and day out, at Royal 
Victoria hospital on a lot of the shifts. She has been on different 
floors doing testing and what have you. I wanted to take this 
opportunity to also thank her for all her efforts.</span></p>

<p><span id="para219">She is a single mom and she has a 12-year-old son.
 You can only think of the challenges that she has had to overcome, like
 finding daycare. Of course, that’s something our government also took 
action on: providing daycare for our emergency workers and individuals 
like her, so that she can have someone take care of her son. So that’s 
wonderful to see.</span></p>

<p><span id="para220">I would be remiss if I didn’t mention our 
paramedics, because it’s paramedics’ week. Certainly, they’re working 
day in and day out, and they look to their parliamentarians to respect 
the breadth of democracy and those who came before us, who fought in 
World War I and World War II so we can have the freedoms that we uphold 
within this Legislature, to debate and to have that discussion, which is
 another reason why this motion is so important.</span></p>

<p><span id="para221">Going back to paramedics’ week and how important 
it is to recognize those paramedics: When you do call and you need 
someone to help, they’re often the first ones to the scene, and they’re 
there to help you during challenging times. I know that when you do make
 that phone call, you’re in a very vulnerable situation. They are calm, 
collected and they are really out there.</span></p>

<p><span id="para222">They’ve always done a lot in the community. I 
know, back home in the Simcoe county area, every summer they do the 
stretcher race. I know that the minister for women and children did that
 stretcher race with me last summer. We would take turns riding the 
stretcher. They are all pushing the stretcher. They’re not just doing it
 for publicity; they’re doing it for the community, for fundraising. 
They did it to raise money for a cath lab, to save lives at Royal 
Victoria hospital. If you are a heart patient, we know that time is 
muscle, and that the sooner you can get that heart patient to the 
hospital, the quicker you can save their life. So they went out on this 
very hot day—I would say that it’s very much like the day we have 
today—and they were just pushing the stretcher, and here I was, lying in
 it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para223">So I want to thank all the Simcoe county 
paramedics, of course, for all of the work they’ve been doing every 
year, day in and day out. They don’t take Christmas off. They don’t take
 Thanksgiving off. They’re always there. They don’t take summers off 
either. Again, we owe it to them to do our work as best as we can to 
uphold democracy, just as they do in the health care field, upholding 
their medical obligations and being out there to save lives.</span></p>

<p><span id="para224">On the topic of saving lives, we had, yesterday, a
 grand achievement within this Legislature. My colleague from 
Eglinton–Lawrence tabled a bill that does that very thing: save lives 
for those who may need access to a defibrillator. There are many public 
areas that don’t have a defibrillator.</span></p>

<p><span id="para225">I think of, back home in Barrie—we have a very 
tragic story: Chase McEachern. He was a young hockey player and he 
needed a defibrillator, but it was not there in time. So his parents—it 
was a challenging time for them, of course, to mourn the loss of their 
young son—wanted to do something about it to prevent other moms and dads
 to see that happen to their children. So many hockey arenas now have a 
defibrillator. But that same opportunity and possibility to save lives 
that is in our hockey arenas today isn’t in all public areas. For that 
family, the Chase McEachern family in Barrie, it means so much to them.</span></p>

<p><span id="para226">I wanted to thank the member from 
Eglinton–Lawrence for her ability to get this bill forward and pass it, 
and work with so many people. We worked with members of the opposition 
on it as well, and there was support from all around. It really shows 
you what can be accomplished in this Legislature when we do work 
together. And hey, we’ve got all summer now to work together, so there’s
 a lot of things to look forward to.</span></p>

<p><span id="para227">Again, when we talk about our member, she has been
 working really hard on that private member’s bill, so it’s good to see 
it achieved. The fact that it is going to be saving lives across the 
province—and that we can look back and say that during this pandemic, 
yes, the government and the entire Legislature unanimously agreed on 
motions like the emergency orders motions. We worked together on that. 
Protecting workers: We came back and did that.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para228">0930</span></p>

<p><span id="para229">But it shouldn’t just stop there; we need to keep 
going. There’s a lot more business that we need to have happen within 
this Legislature to bring progress to Ontario, because when you think 
about it, yes, there is a health care pandemic, but there are huge 
economic consequences. For the first time, I’ve heard a lot of 
individuals from all different walks and parties actually talk about 
businesses and the struggles they are going through. We have that 
commonality here in the Legislature, wanting to help small businesses, 
which is great because, as we know, they are the creators of the mass 
majority of jobs in our ridings.</span></p>

<p><span id="para230">You just take a drive in anyone’s riding, whether 
you’re in Kenora or you’re in Barrie or you’re in Muskoka or 
Eglinton–Lawrence or Markham–Stouffville: You see these businesses and 
their empty parking lots. They’re empty. Finally they’re coming back, 
but now that they are able to open their doors, if they have a 
street-front entrance, they are able to work, so why can’t they expect 
the same of their elected members? Which is why we are here—to really 
stand up for them and get things moving.</span></p>

<p><span id="para231">We talk about the supply chain. One of the things 
in this motion is talking very much about the supply chain when it comes
 to our agriculture sector. I know that in Innisfil—it’s not a surprise;
 it’s a statistic all around the world: We have more chickens than 
people. The agriculture sector there is certainly thriving. There’s not 
going to be a takeover any time soon, I’m hoping, but it is certainly 
thriving. We have a lot of dairy farmers, and certainly we’ve seen the 
impacts of dairy within this pandemic, of course.</span></p>

<p><span id="para232">I know that our Minister of Agriculture, Food and 
Rural Affairs—I’ve been on several phone calls and Zoom meetings with 
him and with my local agricultural workers. These folks don’t get 
thanked enough, so I want to thank all the agri-food workers, those 
working at food processing plants, and our farmers. You’ve really 
stepped up to the plate for this pandemic. I’ve seen countless stories 
of food bank donations. I know that our colleague from Mississauga has 
been working with Sobeys to deliver food. We’re calling him our new Uber
 Eats politician because he’s bringing food to all communities. In fact,
 in my own community, Nutrafarms is a place that provides local meats. 
They were able to donate some of their local meats to his efforts to 
deliver to families. Likewise, we are working with some local onion 
farmers to get some onions to make some recipes that he’ll be delivering
 to residents. So you really see how important that food supply chain 
is.</span></p>

<p><span id="para233">We need to address some of the red tape that 
happens within that food supply chain, and I certainly heard a lot of 
that through folks in my riding and a lot of farmers, and that’s why one
 of the things we will be debating this summer has to do with just that:
 with our agricultural sector and being able to get at some of the red 
tape that exists within the ag sector, but also to protect our farmers 
and protect the livestock. I think that a lot of us talk about 
biosecurity. That’s so important, and that is certainly something we’re 
going to be doing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para234">The other thing we talk about is how we actually 
transport those goods. We’ve got our member from Mississauga, who is 
getting in his car and delivering the food, but you need proper roads 
and you need proper bridges to get those supplies to market. When it 
comes to infrastructure and transit development of any kind, that is 
just so important to the entire supply chain, so of course it’s a very 
big priority. It’s something we embarked on as a province. It’s 
certainly a challenge, especially when we think about the Toronto 
Transit Commission and being able to fix some of that movement of 
people. You can say that that is the service sector, getting people from
 point A to point B to their jobs, to their loved ones, and to get those
 support workers to their destination if that’s the method of 
transportation they are using. They rely on and expect that when they 
are working really hard day and night and working those night shifts, 
they have proper transit that gets them to where they need to go. It’s 
one of the things we’ll be debating again this summer and will be 
working on, because a lot of those individuals are working and they rely
 on us to do the same.</span></p>

<p><span id="para235">So, again, tying this back to the motion at hand, 
and thanking all those—something that hasn’t been mentioned a lot, but I
 know that our Minister of Transportation, our Associate Minister of 
Transportation, and our workers who are getting us from—the GO train 
drivers are still operating. The GO train, the GO bus drivers and the 
Toronto Transit Commission drivers, whether they’re driving the subway 
or the streetcar—all the stuff that they’re doing. The maintenance crew 
that are behind all of those efforts—to thank them, because they’re 
working through this whole pandemic. If there is a call for something 
that needs to be repaired, no matter what time of day it is, they’re 
there.</span></p>

<p><span id="para236">Likewise, as parliamentarians, we owe it to them, 
too, to be here and to be able to work throughout the summer on 
accomplishments for taxpaying residents of Ontario and all Ontarians. 
It’s so vital. But I did want to also take that moment to thank those 
workers because they’re out there, getting many residents to where they 
need to be, and doing it safely. We’ve seen many examples around the 
world of how you can use public transit safely. Certainly, all of them 
are washing their hands or they’re wearing gloves. We’ve heard a lot 
about, if you are in confined spaces, to wear a mask, and some of those 
things that you have to do.</span></p>

<p><span id="para237">On the topic of masks, it’s incredible to see how 
many people in our communities—I’m sure that all of you have examples of
 the families that step up to make these homemade masks. I know that the
 Richardson family—Jennifer Richardson’s husband has been at his sewer 
this whole time, making handmade masks for everyone in Barrie–Innisfil. I
 have picked up several masks from him for myself—I have one today with 
me. Certainly, I wear that when I need to wear it, but I have also been 
able to pick up masks for our senior communities that are in independent
 living and in their homes, and they may need those things. They’ve 
really stepped up to the plate to make those masks. Certainly, we’ve 
seen many other individuals throughout the riding who have been making 
those masks.</span></p>

<p><span id="para238">I know that as I look around to my colleagues, as 
they were walking in here today some had their masks on. A lot of them 
were also made in their ridings—homemade. Some of them have personal 
touches and different colours; that’s really nice to see. But that’s the
 positive side of things. I think there is a lot of negativity out 
there. There is a lot of anxiety and stress. We have to hold on to those
 really positive stories in our community and thank the individuals for 
stepping up when it comes to this pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span id="para239">A lot of them who may be at home—they don’t have 
the ability to have a job. Maybe they have applied for the Canadian 
emergency relief benefit or other things. At least they know that, with 
the job protection legislation that we passed in this Legislature 
unanimously with support by all parties, they will still have a job to 
go to. But all of us also owe it to those individuals. We’re so 
fortunate to represent the people of Ontario. We have to ensure that we 
are here, working and passing legislation that will affect them 
first-hand because, coming out of this pandemic, it’s going to be all 
hands on deck as to how we get the economy rolling again.</span></p>

<p><span id="para240">I know that the Premier has committed to never 
being reliant on other countries or being vulnerable to not be able to 
secure personal protection equipment. That’s a huge economic opportunity
 in our province. We just saw yesterday—we’ve got the member for Whitby 
here. The General Motors plant is going to be making a lot of masks, 
which is incredible. That is a made-in-Canada and made-in-Ontario 
solution to this huge problem. But think about the jobs it’s going to 
create for the member for Whitby and those workers that can go back to 
work.</span></p>

<p><span id="para241">Our Minister of Finance has launched these jobs 
and recovery committees. I’ve had several already. One thing I had 
mentioned on the jobs and recovery committee is, when it comes to the 
auto sector and what they’re doing, they test their workers every day. 
They’re screening them. And they can call in; if they have any symptoms,
 they don’t have to go in to work. All these things are happening to 
protect our workers.</span></p>

<p><span id="para242">When we came together in this House to pass that 
bill, it was great because it really complemented a lot of those efforts
 that they’re doing right now within the other sectors of our economy 
that are so vital to keep things rolling and to keep things going. 
That’s going to be so critical after this, as we get through this 
together and as we turn our minds to what the Ontario economy looks 
like.</span></p>

<p><span id="para243">A lot of the things that are in the motion that we
 are debating today are very much a part of that: rolling the economy 
and being able to say, “Within the ag sector, what are we doing to 
protect the supply chain, to protect our livestock and to protect our 
farmers? But also, how do we get people moving with transit, and 
thanking all those transit workers?”</span></p>

<p><span id="para244">When it comes to community care and community 
medicine, we’ve seen how important it is. I’ve seen it. I spoke to it 
last week—our many senior homes in the ridings and the amount of work 
that those are doing. But there are a lot of seniors that live 
independently in their home. They want to stay there as long as 
possible.</span></p>

<p><span id="para245">Sandycove Acres is known to be the community of 
golf carts, and yes, they get around the community in their golf carts. 
Their most famous event is their Canada Day parade, where they all 
decorate their golf carts and go out and parade, and I’m in there and my
 fellow member of Parliament is there. Unfortunately, it won’t be 
happening like it normally does this year, but we’ll find an alternative
 way to make it happen safely.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para246">0940</span></p>

<p><span id="para247">But what did those members of Sandycove Acres do 
to help this pandemic? There were these ladies that lunch who get 
together, a group of seniors who get together, and they do fundraisers. 
The Barrie women’s shelter often relies on many donations. They receive 
some government funding, both federally and provincially, and through 
the county. But these ladies couldn’t get together to physically lunch 
because they wanted to be safe, of course—they’re part of the more 
vulnerable population—so they went online. They took to Facebook instead
 of all getting together for lunch, and they asked everyone to put in 
$10. Their goal was to raise about $1,000, and they exceeded that goal. 
They were able to get a cheque from the Sandycove Acres ladies that 
lunch group and send it to the Barrie women’s shelter. Where there is a 
will, there is a way, Mr. Speaker.</span></p>

<p><span id="para248">Here, too, this government has a will to work and 
help all Ontarians, as I know all members of the House have a will to do
 that, because we do come here every so often to extend the emergency 
orders, and we do come back here to have question period and to have 
that democratic debate—so, so important. It makes me think of all those 
other efforts we have throughout our ridings with people who constantly 
work and put those efforts in.</span></p>

<p><span id="para249">But I just wanted to mention some of those things 
and just remind people why we’re here, and really kind of reach—this is 
really formidable for all of us in our ridings. No one could predict 
this was going to happen. All of us owe it to really step up and do what
 we can to help our communities, like I was saying earlier, whether it’s
 delivering groceries or I know many of our members have been out there 
delivering personal protective equipment to local residents. I know that
 care kits have also been delivered, a lot of that, and just those 
feel-good efforts so that we can really get through this with kindness 
and positivity and not negativity.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para250"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The member for Sudbury I think has a point of order.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para251"><strong>Mr. Jamie West:</strong>
 I appreciate all the comments and the information about what’s 
happening in the member’s riding. I don’t see how it relates to the 
motion under debate. It was a last-minute motion that was brought 
forward. I’m interested in hearing about why it is very important. The 
other colour commentary is interesting, but I feel like we’ve sort of 
veered into the weeds, and I was wondering if we could get back on 
track.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para252"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong>
 The member is quite right: The comments in the debate have to relate to
 the motion or the bill. But I find that the member for Barrie–Innisfil 
is speaking to the motion, and would ask her to continue.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para253"><strong>Ms. Andrea Khanjin:</strong>
 Thank you to the member opposite, but they’re just examples to show you
 that while people are working and doing all these efforts in all of our
 communities, we also owe it to them to be here and to be working on 
those efforts.</span></p>

<p><span id="para254">Some of the bills that I had mentioned in the 
motion that we will be debating have first-hand impacts on local 
members. I know we had another member, from Etobicoke–Lakeshore, come to
 Innisfil, to the Harry Eisses farm, where biosecurity is really 
important to them. So passing the biosecurity is so important.</span></p>

<p><span id="para255">We saw first-hand what Harry Eisses does, where, 
before you walk in to see where the egg production is made and all of 
that is done, you’ve got to put on layers: You’ve got to cover your 
shoes; you’ve got to cover your clothes; you’ve got to wear a hairnet, 
gloves, everything. Think about what’s happening now. Everyone is 
wearing gloves and covering their face and whatnot. But that’s their 
day-to-day. That’s how they protect their chickens to make sure that 
there is no infection that happens there.</span></p>

<p><span id="para256">Certainly, we were able to walk through and see 
how amazing his operation was, and, more importantly, how important this
 bill is going to be to him, because for him, that’s his livelihood. If 
there is some sort of infection or some sort of outbreak at his chicken 
farm, that’s his livelihood. But also, just from a caring perspective, 
those are animals that you don’t want to see hurt. You don’t want to see
 them ill, just like you don’t want to see a human ill. Certainly, 
that’s something that he cares about. You have a lot of cattle 
farmers—same thing. They don’t want to see their cattle ill because 
someone has marched onto their property, trespassing illegally, not 
allowed, and suddenly you have an outbreak there.</span></p>

<p><span id="para257">I think, now more than ever, this is so relevant 
and so important because we’ve seen what has happened with the outbreaks
 in our community with COVID-19, but you imagine what the other side of 
things are, what happens in our agri-food sector, that you don’t want 
that happening. That is our food supply.</span></p>

<p><span id="para258">I know right now—he normally has this part of his 
farm where you can go in. He calls it the vending machine for eggs, but 
really it’s just that you take the eggs you want to buy and you drop off
 the money. It’s the honour system. There’s a little till there to make 
change if you need change, and you pick up your eggs. But right now, 
during this pandemic, that area is closed. Again, he wants to protect 
his livelihood but also the chickens so that there’s no outbreak or 
anything amongst his workers or amongst the chickens there. There are 
actually pylons when you drive by; there are lots of pylons.</span></p>

<p><span id="para259">I’ve had many residents ask me when they are going
 to open, because they want their fresh eggs. Unfortunately, I can’t 
really give them much of a reply because we have to take safety and 
health—utmost importance. Certainly, that takes precedence, but it shows
 you why our supply chain and the agri-food bill that we will be 
debating this summer are so important.</span></p>

<p><span id="para260">When I talked about the Minister of Agriculture—he
 actually came to Innisfil, and we did a round table with farmers about 
the bill. You had grain farmers and you had livestock farmers etc., and 
they said that this was needed years ago. They’re finally excited that a
 government is actually moving through with it. So that’s very good to 
hear.</span></p>

<p><span id="para261">I know that the member for Eglinton–Lawrence—of 
course, transit is very important to a lot of members. Another thing 
we’ll be talking about this summer is really getting people moving. We 
owe it to Ontarians to have a state-of-the-art transit system. Frankly, 
when we all travel—when we were allowed to travel before COVID-19—if you
 compare Ontario to other areas, again, you talk about movement of 
goods, but you also talk about the service sector and movement of 
people. That has to be seamless. That’s going to have a huge impact on 
our economy. If we can get that right, that has a direct impact on our 
economy, and we need that more than ever coming out of COVID-19 because 
of all the things that are linked to transit projects. That’s a lot of 
jobs, job creation—the entire supply chain.</span></p>

<p><span id="para262">Near my riding I have Decast. It’s just outside 
the riding. They actually make all the molding for the subways. They’re 
ready. They said, “It’s great. You guys, when you’re getting this 
better, faster transit stuff through”—they’ll want to come to the helm 
to help. It’s local pride for a lot of people, but that’s jobs.</span></p>

<p><span id="para263">They do have a few jobs open now. They’re still 
going and they’re still working—working safely. Certainly, if there’s 
anyone watching at home who is looking for job opportunities, there are 
lots out there. I’ve seen a lot of “help wanted” signs. Those economic 
opportunities exist out there.</span></p>

<p><span id="para264">We, as a government, have the opportunity to make 
even more economic opportunities coming out of this pandemic, and that 
is through a lot of this legislation that we’re going to be debating 
here over the summer. I want to thank everyone for their time. I look 
forward to seeing you in the summer and having more progress.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para265"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para266"><strong><span id="P279_52734">Ms. Peggy Sattler:</span></strong>
 I rise today to participate, in the debate on this motion that was 
brought forward by the government, as the acting House leader for the 
official opposition. I want to say at the outset how striking is the 
difference in tone in this Legislature yesterday and today when you 
reflect back on the earlier sessions we have come together for during 
this state of emergency.</span></p>

<p><span id="para267">Yesterday, we saw the government bring forward 
three bills with no notice whatsoever to the official opposition. Very 
late yesterday, they scheduled this motion that we are debating today 
with, again, very, very little notice to the official opposition. The 
other days that we had met in this place were determined through a 
process of negotiation and collaboration and consensus. That, Speaker, 
is how the people of this province of Ontario expect us to function in a
 democracy in the middle of a pandemic. It’s more important than ever 
that we have that kind of cross-party negotiation, discussion, 
collaboration and agreement—agreement on what we should be talking 
about, what the priorities are of the people who we represent, and what 
the concerns are that all of us bring on behalf of our constituents.</span></p>

<p><span id="para268">It is disappointing, as I said yesterday, that the
 government has chosen to depart from the way that we have functioned 
previously. The state of emergency is still very much in effect, and yet
 we have this new, kind of arbitrary approach by the government as to 
how we are going to do business in this Legislature.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para269">0950</span></p>

<p><span id="para270">I heard the member from Barrie–Innisfil talk about
 the democratic process. Speaker, it is so disrespectful to democracy to
 act in the way that we see this government acting, to act in the way 
that we saw them act yesterday. Bringing bills forward with no advance 
notice to the official opposition limits our ability as MPPs to 
participate meaningfully in the debate and bring forward the concerns 
that our constituents want us to talk about. But most of all, in the 
middle of a pandemic, the concerns and priorities of our constituents 
have shifted, Speaker. People are looking at the most pressing issues 
that are before them, and the bills that we talked about yesterday 
really had nothing or very, very little to do with the issues that we 
are facing in this COVID-19 emergency.</span></p>

<p><span id="para271">One of the most disappointing things that we saw 
here yesterday was the government voting against a unanimous consent 
motion to allow the critic for the official opposition to stand down the
 lead on Bill 184, a bill that addresses social housing in the province 
and purports to provide further protections for tenants.</span></p>

<p><span id="para272">You know, the government operates with cabinet 
ministers who are supposed to have knowledge of their files, and that is
 how the official opposition is structured as well. We have critics who 
have a lot of knowledge and expertise in their files and who get 
briefings from the ministry about legislation that is going to be 
brought forward. It is the critic’s responsibility to do the in-depth 
analysis of the bills that we are going to be debating in this place. To
 refuse the opportunity for our critic to participate in the debate was 
really unconscionable. It was disrespectable to the democratic process. 
It was disrespectful to the way that we are supposed to treat each other
 in this place, listen to each other in this place and, through our 
voices, listen to the views of the people we represent.</span></p>

<p><span id="para273">I have to stay, Speaker, I don’t know if you had 
an opportunity to read some of—there were some recent articles in the 
New York Times about the countries that have been most successful in 
dealing with COVID-19. Interestingly, they are led by women. In 
particular, Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand is being held up as a model 
leader, but others—Angela Merkel in Germany; the Prime Minister of 
Finland—these are countries that operate on a system of proportional 
representation. In my critic responsibility within the official 
opposition, that is another one of my critic roles: democratic reform. 
You have to reflect on the way that an embedded system of proportional 
representation forces parties to work together. It forces solutions to 
be worked out that take into account the views of many diverse opinions 
and people who have different political perspectives. You reach a better
 decision once you engage in processes like that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para274">The motion that we have before us today is the 
counter. It’s the exact opposite of the approaches that have been so 
effective in other countries that have political systems that allow the 
back and forth and that allow the participation of all members of the 
Legislature in determining how the government is going to address the 
needs of the people in Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para275">This motion proposes that the Legislature return 
beyond the already agreed-upon sitting days—as I pointed out, those 
dates were set through a process of consensus and negotiation at the 
House leaders’ meeting. But this motion proposes additional sitting 
days: four additional days in June and nine additional days in July. For
 people in Ontario who hear that, they may think it’s really important 
that the Legislature continue to sit, that the Legislature debate issues
 that are critical to our ability to move through this pandemic, to 
reopen the economy safely, to ensure that workers are protected, to 
address the horrifying situation in our long-term-care facilities. These
 are all high priorities for our constituents. People seeing this 
motion, hearing that there are 13 more days that the government has 
proposed that the Legislature convene, might think this is a good idea 
because we’re going to be able to really look at issues related to 
COVID-19.</span></p>

<p><span id="para276">Unfortunately, when you actually look at the 
motion, after it sets out the 13 additional sitting days, it dictates 
exactly what is going to be addressed in those additional sitting days. 
Nothing that the government wants to address, that’s set out in this 
motion, relates to COVID-19. That is a concern. That is a real concern. 
We see a government that is blindly focused on continuing to push 
through its agenda, and it’s using its power as a majority government to
 bring in a motion that is going to do exactly that: to push through 
four pieces of legislation that were developed long prior to the 
pandemic and really are not the top-of-mind concerns for people that we 
represent.</span></p>

<p><span id="para277">Not only that; this motion proposes to use a 
virtual committee process to deal with these bills, to get public input 
on the content of these bills. My friends from the independents and the 
Liberals and the Greens are not here today, but certainly they were with
 me—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para278"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> I’m going to remind the House that you can’t point out the absence of any member.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para279"><strong>Ms. Peggy Sattler:</strong> Apologies.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para280"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> I again recognize the member for London West.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para281"><strong>Ms. Peggy Sattler:</strong> Okay—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para282"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> I know you didn’t mean it in the—but I think I should point that out.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para283"><strong>Ms. Peggy Sattler:</strong>
 My friends from the Liberals and the Greens and the independents will 
know that, during the House leader meetings that we held when we were 
discussing the sittings of the Legislature and the issues that were 
going to be dealt with—they will have heard the government House leader 
say that, given that we have never in this Legislature held virtual 
committee meetings before, we would do sort of a trial run, that we 
would bring forward a single, relatively non-contentious bill—for 
example, a bill like the Legislative Assembly Act, a bill that was dealt
 with rather quickly in this Legislature because there was widespread 
agreement that that the measures set out in that bill would improve the 
functioning of the Legislative Assembly.</span></p>

<p><span id="para284">So the government House leader had said to us, 
“Why don’t we use a bill like the Legislative Assembly Act and do a 
trial run of this virtual committee process, where we’re going to be 
enabling presenters to come and speak before the committee, we’re going 
to be enabling members of the committee to participate virtually?” 
Whenever you implement a new process, there are always going to be 
kinks. There are always going to be unanticipated challenges that need 
to be worked out.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para285">1000</span></p>

<p><span id="para286">Speaker, I cannot understand why this government 
has changed its mind about proceeding in that way and why it has decided
 that it is going to push through four bills which are—honestly, 
Speaker, they are highly contentious bills. They are bills that are very
 polarizing, and this government has decided that they’re going to 
implement a virtual committee process for four bills at the same time. 
It’s not even that they’re doing a single contentious bill and going to 
see how that works out virtually; they’re doing four contentious bills 
at exactly the same time in an untested, untried, brand new virtual 
committee hearing process.</span></p>

<p><span id="para287">That is a real concern, Speaker: whether that 
process is really going to allow people in this province to engage in 
debate on bills that aren’t on the top of their priority list, because 
they’re preoccupied, as they should be, with COVID-19. But still, we do 
want to ensure that when these bills come to committee, there are full 
and meaningful opportunities for the public to participate, so that is a
 concern.</span></p>

<p><span id="para288">The other significant concern with this motion is 
the days that it proposes that the Legislative Assembly meet. The four 
days in June are Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and certainly that is the 
schedule that we have operated under last week, this week and next week.
 I think that that was an agreement that was reached through consensus 
at the House leaders’ meeting, and generally that has worked well for us
 for these three weeks.</span></p>

<p><span id="para289">But at the same time that the government wants to 
push through its legislative agenda, the legislative agenda that did not
 serve the people of this province well—when you think about the cuts to
 public health that compromised our ability to respond effectively to 
this COVID-19 emergency, when you think about the decision to end 
proactive inspections of long-term-care facilities that made our 
long-term-care homes so vulnerable to the devastation of COVID-19, and 
the lack of support for PSWs—at the same time that this government is 
just laser-focused on pushing through its legislative agenda, it is also
 closing its ears to any possibility that private members may have some 
good ideas about how to address the COVID-19 emergency.</span></p>

<p><span id="para290">I know in my community the only thing I’m hearing 
from people in London West is related to COVID-19. Private members’ 
public business, which is held on Thursdays, will not be possible under 
the terms of this motion because this motion proposes, as I said, that 
we sit for Tuesdays and Wednesdays in June, and then Mondays, Tuesdays 
and Wednesdays in July. That completely eliminates any opportunity for 
discussion of private members’ public business.</span></p>

<p><span id="para291">It was interesting. I heard the member from 
Barrie–Innisfil talk about the grand achievement that was secured here 
yesterday in the Legislature with the passing of Bill 141, which was a 
private member’s bill brought forward by the member for 
Eglinton–Lawrence, but more than that, it was the result of a 
collaboration between several MPPs. My colleague the MPP for Nickel Belt
 and the member for Ottawa South had also brought forward PMBs that were
 similar; they dealt with the same issue of the defibrillator registry.</span></p>

<p><span id="para292">As I said, without notice, we had that bill come 
forward here yesterday morning in the Legislature, and we saw its 
passage with support from all members of the House, but that shows you 
the power of private members’ public business. That shows you the 
importance of enabling members to bring forward private members’ bills 
or private members’ motions whenever we gather together to participate 
in this democratic project.</span></p>

<p><span id="para293">We have seen in this place many grand achievements
 as a result of private members’ initiatives. We saw presumptive WSIB 
coverage for PTSD and first responders. Again, that was a private 
member’s bill. That began with a private member’s bill by my former 
colleague the member for Parkdale High Park, and it was taken up by the 
government. My colleague the member for Nickel Belt had a private 
member’s bill on banning tanning beds, and that was also taken up by the
 government and moved forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para294">There are many ways that MPPs can participate in 
the legislative process and bring forward good ideas that everybody 
recognizes are important and that should have an opportunity to be 
considered. Yet this motion that is before us provides no opportunity to
 allow that consideration to happen because it excludes Thursdays from 
the schedule that the Legislature would meet. That, Speaker, is a huge 
loss for democracy and, honestly, for the government.</span></p>

<p><span id="para295">The government does not have a monopoly on ideas 
as to how to respond to COVID-19. Members on our side of the House, 
members of the official opposition, independent members, and even their 
backbench members for goodness’ sake, might have some valuable input 
that should be considered and should be acted on by the government. But,
 as I said, there will be absolutely no opportunity to consider those 
things.</span></p>

<p><span id="para296">I know in my community, one of the things that I’m
 hearing about and am deeply, deeply concerned about that I would be 
interested in as a private member’s motion or a private member’s bill 
has to do with the increase of sexual violence, gender-based violence, 
as a result of this pandemic. We are hearing women’s shelters; their 
calls are through the roof. The calls are absolutely through the roof. 
Even the domestic violence and sexual assault treatment centre at the 
hospital has reported a significant spike in people who are coming to 
the hospital to report a sexual assault. This is a grave, grave concern.
 There is a lot of research to substantiate the high, high risk to women
 as a result of this pandemic. We should be looking at how we are going 
to respond collectively as a province going forward to this abuse that 
so many women have been experiencing throughout this pandemic.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para297">1010</span></p>

<p><span id="para298">Another issue that is of huge concern to my 
community, and I’m sure to all members in this place, is the risks that 
children have been experiencing as their families are struggling with 
the financial hardship of COVID-19. Schools are closed. Child care 
centres are closed. Those are places where, if a child was experiencing 
abuse at home, it could be first identified and then reported to a CAS.</span></p>

<p><span id="para299">I am deathly afraid for all of those children who 
are in maybe a one-bedroom apartment on a high floor, with no access to 
green space. Their parents are struggling with the financial 
consequences of COVID-19. They are struggling to try to implement a 
learn-at-home agenda without technology. Maybe they work in a 
convenience store without access to PPE. They’re coming home. They’re 
worried about carrying infection to their family members. They’re 
worried about whether they are letting down their responsibilities as 
parents to implement learn-at-home. They’re worried about their children
 cloistered in this small apartment without being able to play with 
their friends. I think, Speaker, that there is a very, very real risk 
that we are going to see so many more children who will need supportive 
services after this pandemic ends.</span></p>

<p><span id="para300">Again, when I earlier talked about the government 
being determined to push through an agenda that has not served the 
people of Ontario well, we only have to look at that issue of protection
 for vulnerable children. We saw this government—one of the first things
 it decided to do was to eliminate the Provincial Advocate for Children 
and Youth. And, my goodness, Speaker, if ever there was a time when 
children and youth will need an advocate in this province, it’s in the 
wake of this global pandemic.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para301"><strong>Ms. Catherine Fife:</strong> Who takes away the advocate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para302"><strong>Ms. Peggy Sattler:</strong> Yes.</span></p>

<p><span id="para303">Most recently, in the budget that was brought down
 just prior to the pandemic, we saw significant cuts to children’s 
mental health services. We saw this government re-organize children’s 
mental health, from the Ministry of Children and Youth Services over to 
the Ministry of Health. But in the Ministry of Children and Youth 
Services, there were people there who understood children’s mental 
health. We now have a monster Ministry of Health that is obviously 
preoccupied with other issues. It’s very, very, very concerning, about 
where children are in this government’s agenda. Certainly, we don’t see 
children in those bills that the government is proposing to deal with 
over the summer.</span></p>

<p><span id="para304">I wanted to start to address more specifics of the
 motion. The motion talks about four bills that will go to committee in 
June. There’s Bill 156, and that is the bill that deals with biosecurity
 and the protection of our food supply; Bill 171, the bill that deals 
with building Toronto’s transit; and Bill 175, the bill that deals with 
the reorganization of home care. Speaker, timing is everything. Who 
reorganizes home care in the midst of a global—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para305"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Timing is everything. Exactly; I agree.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P322_71526"><span id="para309"><span id="P322_71561">Homelessness</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para310"><strong><span id="P323_71608">Ms. Rima Berns-McGown:</span></strong>
 Long-term care is not the only humanitarian disaster unfolding in 
Ontario. Homelessness was in crisis before COVID, and now it is a public
 health nightmare.</span></p>

<p><span id="para311">Folks like Michael Eschbach are falling ill to 
COVID because they can’t self-isolate. They are terrified, forced to 
sleep rough or in tents if they don’t want to be in shelters that are 
petri dishes for COVID-19. Shelters, respite centres and drop-ins are 
maxed out. No one can self-isolate. The government has refused to 
explicitly include front-line shelter and drop-in workers in the wage 
top-up so they continue to work multiple sites, potentially carrying the
 infection with them—precisely why COVID exploded in long-term-care 
facilities.</span></p>

<p><span id="para312">There is still no universal testing across the 
shelter system, so the infection continues to spread. When shelter users
 are kicked out for the day, they share public spaces, including 
transit, with essential workers, contributing to the community spread 
that is preventing Ontario from opening safely. Clearing encampments 
without offering people hotel rooms where they can self-isolate 
contravenes United Nations and CDC guidelines, but cities do it anyway 
because they don’t have enough hotel rooms.</span></p>

<p><span id="para313">Cities are overwhelmed. The province needs to step
 up and provide the money and logistics for hotel rooms for all 
Ontario’s unsheltered people.</span></p>

<p><span id="para314">This is a nightmare that is about to become worse:
 people who have lost their jobs, who can’t pay their rent or arrears 
are going to swell the ranks of the homeless, and Bill 184 actually 
makes it easier for landlords to evict tenants mid-pandemic. The 
government needs to fix this now.</span></p>

 Today I would like to take this opportunity to say how absolutely 
humbled I am to represent the riding of Hastings–Lennox and Addington. I
 continue to be inspired by the exceptional kindness of so many 
individuals in this very challenging time. Like so many across the aisle
 and here, my heart is broken as I witness the hardships, the pressure 
this pandemic has caused for so many people and to so many businesses. 
My team has worked tirelessly to answer questions and provide resources

demonstrated tremendous leadership: engaging with stakeholders and

 the power of information and innovation, and the spirit of 
co-operation. I am confident and I remain confident not only in our

<h3><span id="P332_74973"><span id="para319"><span id="P332_75008">Long-term care</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para320"><strong><span id="P333_75057">Ms. Teresa J. Armstrong:</span></strong>
 Yesterday, the Canadian Armed Forces released a report on the state of 
the five long-term-care homes that they were deployed to because of the 
coronavirus. What the Canadian Armed Forces uncovered was unspeakable. I
 can’t imagine how families and their loved ones in long-term care are 
feeling, how they are processing this information, and how they must be 
filled with worry and, quite frankly, disgust.</span></p>

<p><span id="para321">My office heard from Lyndsay that her 
mother-in-law shares a room with someone who had tested positive for 
COVID, and the for-profit long-term-care facility didn’t know what to do
 in that instance. It took days before she was removed from that room 
she was sharing with someone.</span></p>

<p><span id="para322">We cannot allow this government to express outrage
 with words of anger on the failings of what’s happening. They are part 
of that. There are many governments that are at fault here, but what we 
need to do is we need to make sure we can take action. We need to make 
sure we can get inspections back on track, take over all long-term-care 
homes that are not safe, and call on this government to put a full, 
independent, transparent inquiry. It’s a find-and-fix. It doesn’t mean 
that they can’t make interim changes that will actually help families 
and their loved ones suffering in long-term care now. They have been 
suffering under the coronavirus and have been suffering before.</span></p>

<p><span id="para323">We need to make sure we do the right thing. This 
is or opportunity. I call on this government for a full public, 
independent inquiry.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P337_76692"><span id="para324"><span id="P337_76727">COVID-19 response</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para325"><strong><span id="P338_76779">Mr. Logan Kanapathi:</span></strong>
 Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Throughout these challenging times, we have 
all witnessed incredible acts of kindness, generosity and compassion in 
our communities.</span></p>

<p><span id="para326">Ontario’s front-line health care professionals 
deserve our thanks for their sacrifice and determination to saving lives
 and defeating this disease. Like other front-line medical 
professionals, my wife is a medical doctor. I admire her courage and 
commitment to her patients every morning she leaves the house for work.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para327">1020</span></p>

<p><span id="para328">In my riding of Markham–Thornhill, I receive phone
 calls almost every day from doctors, nurses, personal support workers 
and other front-line staff. I know we say it every day, but we can’t say
 it enough: These people are our heroes. There also are many ordinary 
people doing extraordinary things. I have worked with community donors 
not just in Markham but across the GTA to deliver face masks, meals and 
other essential supplies to those most in need.</span></p>

<p><span id="para329">I want to say thank you to the generous support 
from SDI Supplies, Exact Imaging, Claire Lin, Peter Zhou, SuOn Academy, 
Parya Trillium Foundation, the Islamic Society of Markham and the 
Indo-Canadian community for your efforts. The kindness you have shown to
 your fellow Ontarians during this time is an example to us all.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P343_78202"><span id="para330"><span id="P343_78237">Northern municipalities</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para331"><strong><span id="P344_78295">Mr. Guy Bourgouin:</span></strong>
 Small municipalities in the north face a devastating fiscal situation. 
While they all have limited fiscal capacity, small towns must face new 
COVID expenses and keep up with infrastructure that cannot be shut down.
 Moosonee, for example, continues to operate the main airport of the 
James Bay, in spite of having lost most revenues. They must keep the 
airport alive because they serve medical, flood, forecasting and cargo 
operations. Also, most northern municipalities have taken relief action.
 Hearst, for instance, paused a tax increase while facing a revenue loss
 of a quarter of a million dollars between mid-March and April. Other 
towns have waived interest and penalties, offered payment deferrals or 
service rebates to small businesses.</span></p>

<p><span id="para332">Not long ago the Premier said that he won’t spare a
 penny to help the people of Ontario. Families, people and workers 
depend on northern, small towns’ services and infrastructure. The 
Premier needs to stick to his word and offer direct financial aid to 
northern municipalities before it’s too late.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P346_79397"><span id="para333"><span id="P346_79432">Family caregivers</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para334"><strong><span id="P347_79484">Mr. John Fraser:</span></strong>
 This pandemic has been hard on families across this province, 
especially families in long-term care, those families who have someone 
who is sick and being treated in hospital, and someone who is 
chronically ill. There’s some risk in this pandemic where we may lose 
something that’s really important, lose our humanity. One of the things 
we are at risk of losing is the role of essential family caregivers and 
the role that they play to keep their loved ones well: sometimes feed 
them, sometimes bathe them, sometimes avoid medical accidents, to ensure
 that they get the care that they need. Essential family caregivers are 
just that: They’re essential. They are not visitors.</span></p>

<p><span id="para335">When I read the story of Leonard Rodriguez this 
week, where his wife was not allowed to come into the emergency room 
with him, even though he was desperately ill—then, he was sent home. I 
wondered, if she had been there, would he have been sent home? That’s 
happening across this province in hospitals and long-term care. This 
government needs to have a plan to bring essential family caregivers 
back into health care situations. It needs to be part of our pandemic 
plan because, simply, it’s better for patients, it’s safer for them and 
it’s the human thing to do.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P349_80792"><span id="para336"><span id="P349_80827">COVID-19 response</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para337"><strong><span id="P350_80879">Mr. Amarjot Sandhu:</span></strong>
 From the onset of the outbreak of COVID-19, the government of Ontario 
has taken significant steps to curb the spread of this virus and to 
reduce its impacts on the health of Ontarians and our economy. During 
this time of crisis, volunteers and organizations from Brampton West and
 Brampton have rallied to provide support for vulnerable people in 
society. Organizations like Knights Table Brampton, Khalsa Aid, 
Regeneration Outreach, United Sikhs, Canada India Foundation, Ahmadiyya 
Muslim Jama’at, My Indians in Canada Association, care4cause, Punjabi 
Food Seva Mississauga and Brampton, Thapliyal Foundation and other 
similar organizations, and their volunteers are working very hard to 
keep people and families safe, fed and socially supported during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Such organizations and their volunteers are stepping 
up to ensure food can reach Bramptonians who need it the most.</span></p>

<p><span id="para338">Today, I take this opportunity to stand here in 
this House to acknowledge the efforts of these volunteers and our heroes
 out there in Brampton, Ontario and across Canada who are supporting 
communities every single day by ensuring that no one goes hungry during 
these trying times. I salute these unsung heroes and want to reiterate 
that we’re all in this together and hope is on the horizon.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P352_82221"><span id="para339"><span id="P352_82256">Church-Wellesley Village</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para340"><strong><span id="P353_82315">Ms. Suze Morrison:</span></strong>
 I rise today to share my concern with this House and directly with the 
Premier about the future of the Church-Wellesley Village.</span></p>

<p><span id="para341">The Village is more than just a neighbourhood; 
it’s a living, breathing testament to the strength and resiliency of 
queer and trans communities. It’s a gathering place for 2SLGBTQ+ people 
seeking refuge—a place to be themselves, to build community and to 
organize for queer and trans rights.</span></p>

<p><span id="para342">The Village was already suffering from 
skyrocketing rents before COVID-19 even started. It was forcing many of 
our beloved queer- and trans-owned businesses to close their doors 
before the pandemic even started. Over the years, we’ve lost Zipperz, 
the Barn, Fly, Byzantium, Slack’s, Fire, Zelda’s, 5ive, Babylon, Slack 
Alice, the Barracks, the Club, Richmond Street Health Emporium, Roman II
 Health and Recreation Spa and, most recently since COVID-19 started, 
Club120. Many, many more are at risk because of the direct failure of 
both the provincial and federal governments to come to the table with 
meaningful supports for this community. The only rent relief program 
being offered right now relies on commercial landlords to opt in, which 
they are not.</span></p>

<p><span id="para343">The Village needs commercial rent subsidies, we 
need a ban on commercial evictions and we need a real plan that’s going 
to support queer and trans communities. Premier, it takes a village to 
save the Village. I’m asking you to join us today and commit to the 
supports that our community needs.</span></p>

 In the fight against COVID-19, the residents of Scarborough–Rouge Park

work by our neighbourhood groups and organizations, such as the 
Centennial Community and Recreation Association, the West Rouge

<p><span id="para347">My team and I launched the #SpreadKindness 
campaign when a senior contacted me, asking for immediate support in 
providing groceries such as milk, bread, fresh fruit and vegetables for 
120 senior units in his apartment building. These seniors had been 
self-isolating and were running low on food supplies. With the support 
of local business owners, T Dot Auto Collision and Allied Community 
Legal Services, we bought groceries for the entire seniors’ building. 
Since then, we are continuing to spread kindness to hundreds of seniors

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para368"><strong><span id="P381_89290">Ms. Andrea Horwath:</span></strong>
 My first question is to the Premier, whom people deserve to have 
sitting in his place answering questions today. Yesterday, the Canadian 
Armed Forces—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para369"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong>
 I’m going to interrupt the leader and remind all members of the House 
that it’s not appropriate to point out the absence of any member. Again,
 there’s a reason for it. It’s a long-standing tradition. From time to 
time, any of us might be away from the House, so it’s a courtesy to all 
members.</span></p>

<p><span id="para370">Again I’ll recognize the leader of the official opposition.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para371"><strong>Ms. Andrea Horwath:</strong>
 Thank you, Speaker. In these horrifying times, my first question this 
morning comes to the Premier. Yesterday, the Canadian Armed Forces 
presented a devastating report into the neglect and abuse of seniors in 
Ontario’s long-term-care homes. The report is heartbreaking and 
horrifying, especially for families and seniors in these homes. I spoke 
with some family members from Orchard Villa this morning, and they are 
devastated, not because they’re surprised but because it confirms the 
warnings that they had been screaming at this government for weeks.</span></p>

<p><span id="para372">The Premier has had 24 hours to think about it; maybe that’s what he is still doing now, somewhere off in this august place.</span></p>

<p><span id="para373">Will the Premier now agree that the Minister of 
Long-Term Care failed to protect seniors in our homes, and ask for her 
resignation and call for a full public inquiry into long-term care?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para374"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong>
 Once again—and maybe this is the last time, I hope—I’m going to ask the
 members not to make reference to the absence of any other member.</span></p>

<p><span id="para375">I’ll look to the government to respond to the question. The Minister of Long-Term Care.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para376"><strong><span id="P389_91289">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you, Speaker, and thank you for the important question. Our 
government is absolutely committed to transforming long-term care and 
health care. That is why, all this time, we’ve been transforming to 
Ontario health teams and to Ontario Health. We’ve taken the 
long-term-care sector very seriously, understanding the need for 
transformation. I spent almost 30 years as a family doctor, caring for 
people—our most vulnerable people—and understanding their needs. That’s 
what I came here to do.</span></p>

<p><span id="para377">Some of the issues were long-standing; some of 
them had occurred over decades: the staffing crisis, the congestion in 
our homes, the lack of redevelopment. Then COVID hit. COVID has impacted
 homes around the world. Ontario is no different. We have been taking 
measure after measure, tool after tool, to create the stability in these
 homes. We knew these particular homes were in crisis, which is why we 
brought in the Canadian Armed Forces. So I’m very grateful. As we move 
forward, we will be sure to make an independent commission to find the 
solutions and the answers.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para378"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The supplementary question?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para379"><strong>Ms. Andrea Horwath:</strong>
 Families who read devastating reports yesterday of ongoing abuse and 
institutional neglect deserve so much more from their government. 
Instead of acknowledging the role that the cuts and neglect played in 
creating this crisis, the Premier and his minister offered excuses. 
Instead of accountability, the Premier blocked plans for an inquiry and 
defended his team.</span></p>

<p><span id="para380">Seniors are suffering abuse and literally dying in
 long-term-care homes, where they are supposed to be protected. If 
that’s not grounds for dismissal or for an immediate resignation by this
 minister, my question is: What exactly is grounds?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para381"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you again to the opposition for that question. When you look at 
long-term care, as I have for decades, you understand that our most 
vulnerable people are in long-term care. The report was appalling; there
 is no question. How we respond to that now with an independent 
commission that allows the public to be heard, that allows for public 
hearings, that allows for a public report, is absolutely critical. Those
 voices need to be heard.</span></p>

<p><span id="para382">The vulnerable people in long-term care, as I’ve 
said for the past—almost a year since becoming the Minister of Long-Term
 Care. They deserve respect and dignity. I have sung that from the 
rooftops for the last year and all my career as a family doctor, knowing
 that the importance of how we treat our vulnerable in society is how we
 will be judged as a society. So I implore the opposition, who has known
 about the issues in long-term care, to be part of this solution. We all
 play a role in being part of this solution. This cannot be in vain. The
 lives lost must be valued. Thank you.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para383"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The final supplementary.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para384"><strong>Ms. Andrea Horwath:</strong>
 Speaker, a commission is not good enough. That was something that the 
women from the home that I spoke to this morning actually agreed with. 
They think a commission is the wrong way to go, and so do we.</span></p>

<p><span id="para385">The Premier and his minister cannot claim to be 
surprised by a crisis that they had a hand in creating. For months, 
workers in homes and families of residents have been sounding a 
relentless alarm bell about the conditions in long-term care, the 
horrifying things that they were watching before their eyes happening to
 their loved ones in long-term care. The Ford government either knew 
what was happening or chose not to know.</span></p>

<p><span id="para386">The Premier can do the right thing today, admit 
that his Minister of Long-Term Care failed to protect seniors in homes, 
ask for her resignation and call a full public inquiry. Will the Premier
 do that? And if he won’t, why not?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para387"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you again for the question. Long-term care was in crisis before 
COVID hit. Our government was committed, is committed and will be 
committed to the care of and compassion for our most vulnerable 
citizens. I rose in the chamber on March 12 to talk about how this is a 
time for caring and compassion; it is not a time for vitriol. I will say
 today that it is a time for finding solutions.</span></p>

<p><span id="para388">These problems have been festering in long-term 
care for decades. Our government is committed to making sure that 
long-term care is part of the transformation, that it is integrated into
 our health system in a significant way that will make a difference to 
the lives of those living in long-term care and those who have passed 
and to their families and to staff. Our number one commitment was to the
 safety and well-being of residents and staff. That is why this work 
must continue and we must have a full understanding through an 
independent commission.</span></p>

<p><span id="para389">You’ve also heard the Premier say that everything 
is on the table. We had four EOs and changes to regulation to provide 
flexible staffing for our long-term-care homes leading into this, 
anticipating the problems that COVID would cause. We called in the 
military when it was absolutely essential, looking around the world 
where homes have been abandoned.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para390">1040</span></p>

<p><span id="para391">We have taken every measure. I live with my 
conscience. I know that I’ve done everything. I know that our government
 has done everything.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P405_97057"><span id="para392"><span id="P405_97092">Long-term care</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para393"><strong><span id="P406_97141">Ms. Andrea Horwath:</span></strong>
 My next question is also to the Premier. Look, if this was their number
 one commitment, they have failed miserably. They have failed miserably,
 and everybody knows it now. We all knew it before. We did here in this 
chamber, here on the opposition bench, because the previous government 
failed as well. But now everybody knows the failure in long-term care.</span></p>

<p><span id="para394">Yesterday, the Premier claimed he was shocked at 
the treatment of residents in homes like Eatonville Care Centre. Over a 
month ago, on April 24, families of residents of that home filed a 
statement of claim alleging failure to protect residents, including 
sworn affidavits detailing residents not being cleaned after soiling 
themselves, residents being denied testing even when exhibiting signs of
 COVID-19, and one family who did not learn that their loved one had 
COVID-19 until the funeral home actually informed them after his death. 
We read these documents. They were around over a month ago. The media 
reported on these horrifying situations over the last number of weeks.</span></p>

<p><span id="para395">Were the Premier and the minister briefed on this 
situation, and if not, why not? And if so, how can they claim to be 
surprised by what the armed forces found at Eatonville?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para396"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para397"><strong><span id="P410_98579">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you again for the important question. I have said many times that
 long-term-care homes were on the front lines of this battle with COVID.
 When you consider the report, it’s very clear that there was a war 
going on in our homes against COVID—and the fact that the military had 
to be called in to support these homes, and the staffing shortages that 
suddenly became magnified many times more when COVID came into the 
homes. It would spiral into an abyss very quickly, and that’s why the 
military was called in.</span></p>

<p><span id="para398">These are not normal times. We are in a state of 
emergency, and our long-term-care homes have been facing the brunt. All 
the tools that we have taken—we have moved quickly. Government does not 
move quickly, and that’s why we brought emergency orders, to make the 
process faster, to deal in a decisive and swift way. The very last 
emergency order included one case of COVID because that’s why we have to
 move fast. This is a different setting, and our government has taken 
every measure possible.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para399"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The supplementary question.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para400"><strong>Ms. Andrea Horwath:</strong>
 Speaker, the minister stood in this House and assured Ontarians back at
 the end of February that everything had been done, that they had a 
plan, that long-term care was going to be fine. And then the Premier 
talked about “the iron ring” around long-term care. They said they were 
going to spare no expense on long-term care—all of these empty words 
over and over and over again, for weeks and weeks and weeks, while 
family members and residents became more and more desperate.</span></p>

<p><span id="para401">Eatonville and the Hawthorne Place Care Centre 
were also the subject of a court ruling on April 23. A judge intervened 
on behalf of front-line workers at those facilities who were 
desperately, desperately trying to protect residents who were not being 
cohorted, and staff who were denied access to personal protective 
equipment. When those workers first decided to take legal action, there 
were six cases of COVID in that facility. There are now 43 residents who
 are dead.</span></p>

<p><span id="para402">Were the Premier and the minister briefed on this 
court ruling? If not, why not? And if so, how can they claim to be 
surprised by what the armed forces found at Hawthorne Place?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para403"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you once again for the question. Our government has been 
committed, and you can see that from the very beginning of our 
government’s commitments. We look at the 15,000 beds that were to be 
developed and redeveloped. What we’re finding is the ward rooms, the 
lack of redevelopment, the lack of new space. Our hospitals were also at
 capacity with hallway health care. This was an entire system 
reorganization: Ontario Health, Ontario health teams, integrating 
long-term care into that process so that they could be more integrated 
with expertise involving infection control and also the expertise for 
our long-term-care homes so badly needed. Our personal support workers 
were short in supply. We asked the government to help us streamline that
 process to make that easier. The staffing crises, the capacity in our 
hospitals—it all needed addressing, and our government was working on 
that from the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span id="para404">We all know that health care deserves 
transformation. Our most vulnerable people in their time of need deserve
 that care. We’ve taken measures throughout this, and we will continue 
to take measures after years of neglect of this system by the opposition
 not supporting change in long-term—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para405"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Thank you. The final supplementary.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para406"><strong>Ms. Andrea Horwath:</strong>
 In February 2019, the Ministry of Health conducted a resident quality 
inspection at the Altamont Care Community facility. They found that the 
facility failed to keep the home furnishings and equipment clean and 
sanitary, walls were covered in food stains, and residents with bedsores
 were not being properly treated. This resident quality inspection was 
one of only nine conducted in over 626 homes in Ontario. It was one of 
only nine inspected. The Premier scaled those inspections back 
dramatically after private long-term-care operators described those 
inspections as “red tape.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para407">Were the Premier and the minister briefed on this 
inspection report? If not, why not? If so, how can they claim to be 
surprised at what the armed forces found in Altamont?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para408"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong> Thank you again. These homes were in crisis, and that’s why the military was called in.</span></p>

<p><span id="para409">I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the 
majority of our homes and the majority of our personal support workers, 
who are doing, day in and day out, a tremendously challenging job. I 
would make note of the good work being done in many homes.</span></p>

<p><span id="para410">You’ve heard the Premier say that it is not right 
to paint all homes in the same vein as the homes that are in crisis. We 
need to be supporting our homes. We need to be supporting our personal 
support workers and those who are doing a good job who are not in 
outbreak, especially those who are doing important work—crucial work, 
critical work—to support our most vulnerable.</span></p>

<p><span id="para411">Our whole health transformation has been about 
caring for the vulnerable: people in a time of need, whether they need 
acute care or whether they need long-term care. We have started that 
work. It will continue, and it will continue with a commitment that 
other governments have not had.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para413"><strong><span id="P426_104514">Ms. Andrea Horwath:</span></strong>
 Speaker, my next question is also to the Premier—the same Premier who 
cut funding to long-term care and virtually eliminated long-term-care 
inspections, who has no right at all at this point in time to be shocked
 by the state of long-term care, and no credibility whatsoever when he 
says he will investigate.</span></p>

<p><span id="para414">To quote front-line workers, “We have had to fight
 the provincial government every step of the way to ensure 
long-term-care companies were keeping workers and residents safe.... 
These decisions came from his desk.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para415">Why does the Premier think that families desperate
 for change will be content with an internal review led by the same 
Premier and the same minister who have done everything in their power to
 protect the status quo in long-term care and, I would even say, drag us
 backwards in long-term care?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para416"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para417"><strong><span id="P430_105564">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thanks for the question. I have to push back. I have to clarify. I have
 to tell the truth. And the truth absolutely is that the inspections 
were never stopped. We have done more inspections than ever before.</span></p>

<p><span id="para418">What you’re describing is something that started 
with the Liberal government in 2016 after an Auditor General’s report to
 address—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para419"><strong>Ms. Andrea Horwath:</strong> There’s something called facts.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para420"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Order.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para421"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong> —and I think it’s very important that we clarify, because reality matters. The truth matters.</span></p>

<p><span id="para422">Looking at a public inquiry versus a commission, a
 commission will provide us with the answers faster. It will provide us 
with the transparency faster. Public inquiry and commission are both 
included under the Public Inquiries Act. The commission that we’re 
describing, an independent commission, will be a commission that will 
allow public input. It will have a public report. There will be public 
hearings. To construe it in any other way is inaccurate. We need to talk
 about the truth.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para423">1050</span></p>

<p><span id="para424">Health care needs to be transformed. Our 
government is committed to doing that. We will continue to do what we 
started, and we will do it with a commitment that—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para425"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Thank you very much. The supplementary question.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para426"><strong>Ms. Andrea Horwath:</strong>
 Well, I would say to the minister and to the Premier: Resident quality 
inspections matter. They matter. And to take them down to nine a year 
when we have 626 long-term care homes in Ontario is negligent. It is 
them not doing their duty as a government.</span></p>

<p><span id="para427">I would also say that suggesting that a 
behind-closed-doors process is equal to a public inquiry does not pass 
the smell test, because it is not the case. It is not equal. It is 
behind closed doors. It is not public. The Premier either knew about the
 serious problems in long-term care or he chose not to know. Thankfully,
 our armed forces were able to break the iron ring of silence, and I 
have to say thank you again. The Canadian Armed Forces did all of us 
here in Ontario a very important service.</span></p>

<p><span id="para428">Families and front-line workers have been 
consistent and clear that they want real change this time. They want 
real change. Will the Premier do the right thing and call a full, 
transparent, independent public inquiry today?</span></p>

<p><span id="para429">Interjections.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para430"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Members, please take their seats.</span></p>

<p><span id="para431">To reply on behalf of the government, the Minister of Long-Term Care.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para432"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you for the question. Our government is committed, and that’s why
 it began with the redevelopment of our long-term-care system. It put 
almost $2 billion towards building capacity and redevelopment. They’re 
undergoing a staffing study to inform a comprehensive staffing strategy.
 We are addressing Justice Gillese’s report and the important work done 
by the Auditor General as well.</span></p>

<p><span id="para433">This government is absolutely committed to doing 
that. You can see that with the Ontario health teams and Ontario Health.
 We need to address the needs of an aging population, a growing and 
aging population, and support for our most vulnerable people. That’s 
been ongoing. An independent commission that will have public input, 
that will have public hearings, that will have a public report—but the 
Premier has said that all options are on the table. We need expediency. 
We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to do it in a way that is 
transparent.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P447_109559"><span id="para434"><span id="P447_109594">Students</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para435"><strong><span id="P448_109637">Mr. Parm Gill:</span></strong>
 My question is to the Minister of Education. Parents, teachers and 
students in my riding of Milton are doing their best in these very 
difficult circumstances. They’re being flexible, they’re working hard 
and they’re being creative. I’ve heard from countless parents who find 
that their kids are best supported when their teachers conduct live 
classes. This includes Adriana, who says, “As a parent, I would love for
 my kids to get the live interaction with their classmates and teachers 
so they can be engaged and actually learning at this time.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para436">Can the minister please outline what our government expects from educators in delivering at-home learning for our students?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para437"><strong><span id="P450_110403">Hon. Stephen Lecce:</span></strong>
 Thank you so the member from Milton for his question and his 
leadership. I want just to start with a recognition of gratitude to our 
educators, to our students and parents for rising to the challenge in 
this truly unprecedented time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para438">We believe, as students now are spending one 
quarter of their academic year at home, it is incumbent on all of us to 
give them every option, using every opportunity, every tool and every 
technology to aid them in learning while they are home. That’s why we 
believe in, as many parents have called for, live, synchronous learning 
to create a classroom experience that will not emulate the in-class 
experience. We acknowledge that being in class, of course, is best. But 
at the time of COVID-19, we have an opportunity to improve delivery of 
education to these students by embracing that community online. That’s 
why we’re urging our school boards and partners to implement this, 
standardize it and improve learning for all students in this province.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para439"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The supplementary question.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para440"><strong>Mr. Parm Gill:</strong>
 Thank you to the minister for the answer. In these difficult times, 
it’s more important than ever that our education system adapt to the 
needs of students. This is critical, especially when it comes to mental 
health. Anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges are on 
the rise, and tragically, our kids are not excluded from this.</span></p>

<p><span id="para441">I know that mental health is top of mind for our 
government as we seek to support students during these difficult times. 
Can the minister please provide some examples on how our government is 
prioritizing students’ mental health?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para442"><strong>Hon. Stephen Lecce:</strong>
 Thank you again to the member for Milton for the question. I know that 
mental health is a priority for all members of the House, and I actually
 appreciate my conversations with the critics in all parties and the 
leader of the Green Party, discussing this very issue. It is why in part
 the Premier announced some weeks ago an additional $12-million 
investment to support mental health, to enable our young people to have 
the strength that they need through this difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span id="para443">Part of that aid was more funding to Kids Help 
Phone and School Mental Health Ontario to provide a continuum of care. 
We’ve called on boards to unlock all mental health workers and 
para-professionals to do the best they can in a virtual environment. We 
have aided and enabled boards this summer to enable them to continue 
providing services through the summer—normally, they would end in 
June—so there’s a continuity of service delivery for these kids. We’re 
providing more investments in special education, as well as more 
guidance to parents to help them through this difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span id="para444">We’ll continue to invest in mental health, 
continue to invest in our most vulnerable and give them the path to 
success this year to graduate, and in September, when they return to 
class.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para446"><strong><span id="P459_113657">Ms. Teresa J. Armstrong:</span></strong>
 My question is to the Premier. The government spent months saying they 
were monitoring long-term care closely but yesterday claimed to know 
nothing of the horrific conditions in our long-term-care homes. The 
horrifying report from our armed forces comes after the government’s 
decision to virtually eliminate proactive resident quality inspections 
in long-term care. The government insisted that this would have no 
impact on care. In fact, last April, the minister claimed that Ontario 
has “the most rigorous” inspections “in Canada” and didn’t need resident
 quality inspections.</span></p>

<p><span id="para447">Speaker, families are hurting today, and they need
 answers. My question to the Premier: If Ontario actually had a system 
of rigorous inspections, how could they not know what was happening in 
our long-term-care homes?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para448"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Minister of Long-Term Care.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para449"><strong><span id="P462_114653">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you for the question from the opposition. Our government is 
absolutely committed to long-term care and reforming health care. In our
 long-term-care system, we are monitoring the homes. We are moving in 
the right direction. Our homes are improving. There are a handful of 
homes that have been under exceptional stress, largely due to staffing 
issues. We use certain criteria to identify red homes versus yellow 
homes versus green homes. We’ve been actively monitoring that all this 
way.</span></p>

<p><span id="para450">To characterize this as not knowing is inaccurate,
 and it is insulting to all the people who are doing the work on the 
front lines. Our staff, the managers, the personal support 
workers—everyone is contributing. Everyone is doing what they can. We 
all have a role to play. I acknowledge the anger that people are feeling
 from a loss and being in the state of emergency, but anger will not 
bring us solutions; it is dedication, everyday hard work, and making 
sure that we put residents at the centre of care, which has not been 
done.</span></p>

<p><span id="para451">Our government is doing that. When I was speaking 
at the homes that I was visiting for almost a year, I would talk about 
that, and nobody was interested. The media didn’t come. Only at a time 
of death and devastation did people respond. It should not have taken 
that. It should not have taken that.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para453"><strong><span id="P466_116235">Ms. Sara Singh:</span></strong>
 Speaker, it’s difficult to believe that this government had absolutely 
no idea about the crisis in long-term-care homes when conditions like 
the ones detailed in the Canadian Armed Forces report are happening 
across this province, including in cities like Brampton. The Premier 
said himself that he believes that there are also other homes that are 
impacted.</span></p>

<p><span id="para454">Is the Premier and this minister going to keep 
pretending that they had no idea about the conditions in our 
long-term-care homes?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para455"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you for the question. In fact, there was a crisis in 
long-term-care homes. We knew that there was a shortage of personal 
support workers. That contributes greatly in a time of absolute crisis, 
like COVID-19.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para456">1100</span></p>

<p><span id="para457">Our government was transforming long-term care. We
 were in the process of doing that—Ontario Health, Ontario health teams,
 working with public health, working with all our partners and 
colleagues to get through this unprecedented, devastating time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para458">We are in a state of emergency. This is not a

That’s why I’m doing what I’m doing. That’s why our government has

<p><span id="para459">To characterize this as denying the crisis is 
absolutely out of touch. It’s absolutely out of touch. Our government is
 committed, and we will continue our good work.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para461"><strong><span id="P474_117916">Mr. John Fraser:</span></strong> My question is for the Minister of Long-Term Care.</span></p>

<p><span id="para462">We’re all very deeply disturbed by what we read in
 the Canadian Armed Forces report yesterday into the five long-term-care
 homes in this province. Speaker, through you to the minister: When was 
the minister first made aware of conditions in these five homes, and 
what led her to ask for the help of the Canadian Armed Forces?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para463"><strong><span id="P476_118380">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you for the question. We were actively monitoring these homes—as 
I’ve mentioned, red, yellow, green—homes that were particularly on the 
radar for staffing crises. We had been taking measures all along in 
terms of our emergency orders to understand and anticipate how 
government could move quickly.</span></p>

<p><span id="para464">Beyond all the changes and the acknowledgement 
that our whole health care system needed to be improved for our most 
needy and our most vulnerable and those who need it at their time of 
need, we understood the critical nature of the staffing issues—which had
 been a long time festering; many, many years.</span></p>

<p><span id="para465">Looking at how we address that, we had labour 
inspectors. We had our own inspectors from long-term care. We had public
 health risk assessments. We had infection prevention and control teams.
 We had rapid deployment teams from the acute care system. Everything 
was being monitored.</span></p>

<p><span id="para466">COVID takes over homes very quickly. We 
anticipated that these homes would be in dire need, and that’s why we 
brought in the military.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para467"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The supplementary question.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para468"><strong>Mr. John Fraser:</strong> I was hoping the minister would provide a more direct and specific answer as to when she knew.</span></p>

<p><span id="para469">I’m trying to understand when the minister knew 
and what led her to call in the military in the first place, because I 
know that residents, their families, staff, organizations that represent
 them and MPPs in this House have all alerted the government, her 
ministry and her to these concerns. I think for all of us, it’s 
important to establish a timeline here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para470">The situation must have been pretty bleak to make 
the request that the minister did. Speaker, I will ask once again: When 
was the minister first made aware of the conditions in these five homes,
 and what led her to ask for help from the Canadian Armed Forces?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para471"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 We have numerous eyes watching the homes and monitoring, and making 
sure that they’re in close contact with the homes, looking at the red, 
the yellow and the green. These homes were having difficulties; there 
was no doubt about that. As we called in the military—it takes time. 
That’s why I can’t give you a precise date.</span></p>

<p><span id="para472">We looked at how we initiated that. There were 
other ministries involved in that process until we could actually get 
the military in. And as you know, there are other provinces that are 
also affected. Our neighbouring province has needed military help in a 
vast way. We understand the limitations of what our military can do. 
That’s why, as we speak, we’re understanding our next measures to take, 
because the military—we’ve asked them to stay. We’re hoping they will 
stay. We’re asking the federal government to help us.</span></p>

<p><span id="para473">We need that support now, but as our homes stabilize, there will be further measures taken to support them.</span></p>

disturbing report from the Canadian military into the conditions in 
these five long-term-care homes—like these five homes, there are dozens 
of homes with double-digit deaths across this province. Given that the 
ministry’s most prominent response to the Gillese report was to only do 
resident quality inspections—full inspections—in nine out of 626 homes 
last year, Speaker, through you: How can the minister assure Ontarians 
that what was reported today isn’t happening in other homes in this 
province?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para476"><strong><span id="P489_122286">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 If you look at the devastating effect of COVID-19 on our homes that 
were already in crisis situations with staffing going into this 
pandemic, our government and my ministry were taking every measure 
possible to address that. We were looking at volunteer portals. The 
nursing associations were assisting with volunteers. We were looking 
everywhere for support, and our long-term-care homes need to be places 
where people want to work.</span></p>

<p><span id="para477">How we integrate our long-term-care homes with the
 acute care system into a new form, a new way of doing things—the 
previous governments, leading up to this point of being hit by COVID, 
never did that, all these years.</span></p>

<p><span id="para478">These homes were being actively monitored. There 
were investigations ongoing. We had an increase in terms of calls to our
 action line. We had almost 3,000 inspections and numerous other 
inspections, so let’s be honest about this.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para479"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Supplementary question.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para480"><strong>Mr. John Fraser:</strong>
 Speaker, why did it take us a month to raise the wages of the 
lowest-paid workers in long-term care, like other provinces did? Why did
 we take a month not to have workers working in more than one home, to 
stop the spread of disease? Why did we wait months and months to give 
ourselves the power to take over long-term-care homes and then actually 
do it?</span></p>

<p><span id="para481">My colleagues from Ottawa–Vanier, Orléans and many
 members of this House have been raising concerns with the ministry and 
the minister about homes in their ridings, and these concerns are 
genuine. They’re coming from families. Families are telling you and 
staff members are telling you and unions are telling you. Everybody is 
saying this.</span></p>

<p><span id="para482">Learning of yesterday’s reports, it’s natural for 
Ontarians to be concerned about their parents and their grandparents. 
Through you, Speaker, to the minister: How can the government assure 
Ontarians that seniors living in other long-term-care homes across this 
province are not experiencing similar conditions to what we heard 
reported yesterday?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para483"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you for the question. I share concern over our vulnerable people 
in society. Our government embarked on a transformation of care because 
it understood the need. Ontario health teams integrating long-term care 
into our acute care setting and into the community: These are absolutely
 critical pieces as we move forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para484">We’ve done work over the last year. We prepared 
for COVID. COVID has hit the global vulnerable populations of those over
 80 and in long-term-care homes. If you bother to look, if you bother to
 understand what’s happening globally in other countries, you will 
understand that. All these measures, the emergency orders to have 
government work faster—because government does not work quickly—the 
processes we have in place are meant for a time that is not COVID time. 
We have adjusted for that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para485">Our homes are actively being monitored. We know the situation in our homes.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para487"><strong><span id="P500_125634">Ms. Marit Stiles:</span></strong>
 My question is to the Premier. Mr. Speaker, back even as the pandemic 
was just unfolding, sadly, many in the sector—some of us 
included—predicted that this was going to result in a massacre of the 
vulnerable and the old. I, for one, wish that that was not true, and I 
know we all do, but it has come to be.</span></p>

<p><span id="para488">The Premier said yesterday that he was shocked by 
this report from the armed forces, but he and his minister have known 
what was coming, and that’s very clear. I want to just point out that on
 April 28, I wrote to the Minister of Long-Term Care outlining just 
issues that have been raised in my own constituency, in my own riding, 
by members in my community, including the lack of testing of people who 
had family members in long-term care, oversight in long-term care, 
personal support workers who were not allowed—not allowed—to have 
protective equipment. I have yet to receive a response to this letter, 
Mr. Speaker.</span></p>

<p><span id="para489">The minister is right that the situation was in 
crisis for a long time, but this minister and this government have 
failed those families. They have failed the workers who have lost their 
lives in those homes and across this province. I want to ask, Mr. 
Speaker, why the minister has not yet offered her resignation and why 
the Premier has not asked—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para490"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span id="para491">The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para492">1110</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para493"><strong><span id="P506_127233">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 I appreciate the anger that you have, and I appreciate your 
frustration. I look back on the last few months, dealing with our 
long-term-care system in this COVID world we live in, and it is 
absolutely heart wrenching, gut wrenching. As a physician who spent 30 
years not only looking after our vulnerable people but looking after 
members of my own family, to insinuate that I sat there and did nothing 
is absolutely incomprehensible to me when I know the truth; I know the 
reality. I know the commitment that our government has had. I know the 
commitment that I have had. That is why I am here, and that’s why we 
took every measure, every tool, all the emergency orders. Everything was
 on the table. We acted swiftly and decisively.</span></p>

<p><span id="para494">COVID is a beast. And years of neglect by the 
previous government, supported by the NDP, have led us to a precarious 
position for our long-term-care homes. COVID-19 is a beast. It’s been a 
beast around the world. Our government has been committed—it is 
committed now; it will be committed in the future—to making sure that we
 transform health care and long-term care for our most vulnerable.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para495"><strong>Ms. Marit Stiles:</strong> Resign. Resign.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para496"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Order.</span></p>

<p><span id="para497">The supplementary question: the member for Waterloo.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para498"><strong><span id="P511_128686">Ms. Catherine Fife:</span></strong>
 To the Minister of Health: That answer, though, was not good enough for
 the people of the province. In Waterloo region, we’ve seen the painful 
fallout from declining standards in long-term care, like Revera’s Forest
 Heights home. Fifty residents—50—have died from COVID-19 in this home. 
Scared and angry families have reached out to myself and the MPP for 
Kitchener–Conestoga. Why? Because, before COVID-19, families were 
spending up to six hours a day caring for their loved ones. They knew 
that there were no minimum standards of care; they knew that the 
staffing ratios were poor; they knew that there were reduced in-person 
inspections. Families were holding this broken system together. The 
health minister was also Patient Ombudsman. She would have heard these 
serious concerns and the pain from these families. The pain and the 
suffering of these residents is not subject to cabinet confidentiality.</span></p>

<p><span id="para499">To the Minister of Health: We agree that the 
former government neglected our long-term-care system, but it’s this 
government who looked the other way when the pandemic began. There was 
no iron ring around these homes. Why did this minister not act 
decisively?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para500"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> To reply, the Minister of Health.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para501"><strong><span id="P514_130052">Hon. Christine Elliott:</span></strong>
 As the Minister of Long-Term Care has stressed repeatedly today, we 
have taken this seriously from the very beginning, putting in place 
protections for people in long-term care, making sure that we had the 
personal protective equipment that they needed. It might not have been 
used by the management in some of these places, but the personal 
protective equipment was there.</span></p>

<p><span id="para502">In addition to that, as things were worsening, I 
have had discussions with the Minister of Long-Term Care, and we have 
had the arrangement made where hospitals can consider long-term-care 
homes work sites, with the result that people were asked at hospitals to
 go and help in long-term-care homes. Over 40 hospitals have stepped up 
to do that. They are continuing to assist in providing care and they 
will continue to do so until this COVID-19 threat has been dealt with.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P516_130955"><span id="para503"><span id="P516_130990">Broadband infrastructure</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para504"><strong><span id="P517_131049">Mr. Jim Wilson:</span></strong>
 My question is for the Minister of Infrastructure. I am frequently 
contacted by constituents about the need for high-speed Internet in many
 areas of my riding. One recent email was from Essa township councillor 
Keith White, who’s concerned about a resident who may lose her Internet 
service. Like many residents, Keith wants to know what the province is 
doing about improving service, not removing it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para505">The government recently released Up to Speed: 
Ontario’s Broadband and Cellular Action Plan, with the intent of 
expanding broadband and cellular access to rural, remote and northern 
communities. Well, we’ve been hearing these big-dollar announcements 
from provincial and federal governments for years, but there still seems
 to be a problem, particularly in the rural areas in my riding. In fact,
 I have to admit, I made a similar announcement some 20 years ago when I
 was Minister of Energy, Science and Technology, and I’m hoping today 
maybe this minister can do a better job than I did.</span></p>

<p><span id="para506">Can the minister tell the people of Essa township when they will receive up-to-standard broadband services?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para507"><strong><span id="P520_132273">Hon. Laurie Scott:</span></strong>
 Thank you to the member opposite for his question. While our government
 has been a steadfast funding partner for broadband projects in Ontario,
 like the Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology project, known as 
SWIFT, I’m sure the experienced member opposite knows that providing 
reliable and affordable broadband service is a responsibility of the 
federal government. With that being said, I have raised this issue on 
countless calls with the federal minister responsible, urging her 
government to join Ontario and our municipal and private sector partners
 in closing the digital divide that the COVID-19 epidemic has brought to
 the forefront.</span></p>

<p><span id="para508">On this side of the House, we are not about lip 
service, I can assure the member opposite; we are about action. Our 
$315-million action plan has the potential to expand access to up to 
220,000 homes and businesses. It includes a $150-million, Ontario-led 
broadband plan, and nearly $64 million to SWIFT, which includes the 
communities in Simcoe–Grey.</span></p>

<p><span id="para509">I’ll have more to say in the supplementary.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para510"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The supplementary question.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para511"><strong>Mr. Jim Wilson:</strong>
 Thank you to the minister. I know that everyone in the House can agree 
that the need for high-speed Internet is only increasing during this 
time of the COVID-19 virus, because people are working from home and 
because of the e-platform for education.</span></p>

<p><span id="para512">Michael Birch, who lives just three minutes 
outside of Tottenham, says that the lack of Internet options has become 
particularly problematic during this crisis. His household is trying to 
run two essential businesses from home, and his two children are 
completely frustrated trying to access e-learning platforms.</span></p>

<p><span id="para513">Gary Wilkinson, who lives five minutes away from 
Collingwood, told me that when the COVID crisis began, all the Internet 
companies said to him that they would waive overage fees and give 
everyone unlimited data—everyone, it seems, except for folks in rural 
areas. “How,” Gary asks, “is it that in this day and age, proper, 
reliable and affordable high-speed Internet is not available to rural 
areas?”</span></p>

<p><span id="para514">Speaker, can the minister elaborate on her first 
answer and maybe tell me when the rural areas of Simcoe–Grey will 
actually receive Internet services? I am counting on you, Minister, to 
be a better minister than I was and to act and deliver rural Internet 
services to Simcoe–Grey. There is the challenge for you.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para515"><strong>Hon. Laurie Scott:</strong> I thank you and I accept that challenge.</span></p>

<p><span id="para516">As someone who has been born and raised in rural 
Ontario and who represents those rural communities, I understand the 
frustrations raised by the member opposite and his constituents very 
well. While we’re all working remotely to adhere to physical distancing,
 I too have had dropped phone calls and been faded out on Zoom calls, 
and download speeds just aren’t what we need. That’s why we have made 
infrastructure a marquee part of our mandate. We are stepping up to the 
plate. We’re taking a whole-of-government approach to bringing Ontario 
up to speed.</span></p>

<p><span id="para517">I want to commend my colleague the Minister of 
Education for his work in connecting more students to e-learning 
platforms during the COVID-19 outbreak, assuring that every high school 
will have high-speed Internet up this fall; and the Minister of Northern
 Development and Mines for making investments and delivering broadband 
to Indigenous communities and in northern Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para518">Mr. Speaker, I do have more plans coming out 
shortly, and I want to encourage the member opposite to join me in 
asking the federal government to help us bring Ontario up to speed. 
Truly, more than ever, we need all these partners together. We can make 
it happen.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P532_136343"><span id="para519"><span id="P532_136378">Long-term care</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para520"><strong><span id="P533_136427">Mr. Michael Mantha:</span></strong>
 My question is to the Premier. Ontarians know that these problems are 
not new. Just a few months ago, I sat here in my chair and looked at my 
leader when, along with my colleagues, we were accused of being 
fearmongers. Well, the fear is real, Mr. Speaker. Families have been 
hurting for years because of Liberal and Conservative inaction.</span></p>

<p><span id="para521">In January 2018, it was revealed that the former 
government kept a secret list of high-risk facilities. All these 
facilities—the government knew that the long-term-care private operators
 were often breaking the rules, failing to comply with directives and 
not doing their job of taking care of our loved ones.</span></p>

<p><span id="para522">Speaker, the Premier had a list of high-risk 
facilities. Why did it take the military report to say that he is 
shocked by the system, when it has been known for years how bad things 
really are?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para523"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para524"><strong><span id="P537_137500">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you for the question. When I look at long-term care in 
Ontario—you have probably heard me say that Justice Gillese said it was a
 system that was strained. COVID-19 came along and broke it.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para525">1120</span></p>

<p><span id="para526">I cannot speak to any list, because I do not believe that that list is applicable now.</span></p>

<p><span id="para527">If you look at COVID-19, it affected some homes in
 a more disastrous way. Others were unaffected. Over 70% of our homes 
are not in outbreak, and our outbreaks are resolving. The military being
 called in was in anticipation of the monitoring and knowing that these 
homes were in dire situations. I wish I could have been able to pull a 
lever and have them show up the following day. The processes don’t work 
like that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para528">I am grateful to the Canadian Forces for being 
there for our residents, being there for our homes and for our families 
and staff. The red, the yellow, the green were in continual interaction 
with our homes. COVID-19 makes things change very quickly. The speed 
with which COVID-19 takes over a home—when you speak to people who are 
in homes, it is shocking. That’s why the military was there, in 
anticipation of these homes having issues.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para529"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Supplementary question, the member for Mushkegowuk–James Bay.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para530"><strong><span id="P543_138975">Mr. Guy Bourgouin:</span></strong>
 The previous government and this one have been slow to fix the problems
 with long-term care. Back in 2017, the Auditor General found that the 
government cut its inspections after it did a cost-benefit analysis of 
them and found inspections to be too expensive. That change in 
inspections resulted in a backlog of over 3,000 complaints and critical 
incidents. This government kept the new system, which has meant the 
quality of inspections of Ontario’s long-term-care facilities has 
dropped.</span></p>

<p><span id="para531">Why did this government keep a failed inspection system rather than change it?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para532"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you for the question. Issues surrounding inspections have been 
raised from the beginning of this pandemic. We have multiple types of 
inspections. We conducted almost 3,000 inspections, as well as 
inspections of the homes every year.</span></p>

<p><span id="para533">Inspections would not have solved the staffing 
crisis that we experienced with COVID-19. The staffing crisis was 
apparent for years, and our personal support workers were on the front 
lines. It doesn’t matter how many inspections you would have done; it 
would not have provided the care that residents needed. It was a 
staffing crisis, which is exactly why we called in the military, with 
staffing getting sick with COVID-19, having to isolate and perhaps being
 afraid to come in. We know that the military was needed at that time, 
and I am grateful to the military. It is not an issue of inspections.</span></p>

<p><span id="para534">We need to make sure that we understand what’s happening in our homes, and that will be ongoing.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para536"><strong><span id="P549_140752">Ms. Judith Monteith-Farrell:</span></strong>
 My question is for the Premier. Experts have been sounding the alarm on
 the crisis in long-term care for decades. The Premier cannot pretend 
that this is the first he’s hearing of it or that he’s shocked, because 
workers represented by SEIU sent out a cry for help to the government 
and several times since, asking the government to step up and ramp up 
and care when private operators turned them away. Just in January 2020, 
Unifor commissioned the Ontario Health Coalition to produce a detailed 
report called Caring in Crisis, which they gave to the government. 
Workers have been alerting the government for years about this 
situation.</span></p>

<p><span id="para537">Why have the Premier and this government ignored 
cries for help from workers on the front line for two years, when we 
know how badly families have been hurt?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para539"><strong><span id="P552_141741">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you for the question. I do value all these questions. I think 
they are important times to address the stress and strain that long-term
 care has been under.</span></p>

<p><span id="para540">I would like to read you a short message from 
Miranda Ferrier, the national president of OPSWA: “Since the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Long-Term Care has demonstrated 
capable and understanding leadership. The Ministry of Long-Term Care has
 been diligently receptive to the needs of the front-line PSWs.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para541">I want to emphasize how incredibly important it 
is—our front-line staff in our long-term-care homes. That is why our 
government has been conducting an expert panel to study and inform a 
comprehensive staffing strategy going forward. When we inherited the 
situation in long-term care, we understood the need to address the 
staffing, which became a crisis under COVID. That work is ongoing. We 
will continue that work. It’s essential.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para543"><strong><span id="P556_142891">Ms. Suze Morrison:</span></strong>
 Thank you, Speaker. Both the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario 
and the Ontario Nurses’ Association have been telling the Minister of 
Long-Term Care and the Minister of Health about the kind of conditions 
detailed in the CAF report for years now. They both say that they begged
 for this government to improve staffing and funding in long-term care. 
The ONA even said that after calling in the Ministry of Labour to try 
and fix things, they’ve also had to take this government and some 
long-term-care homes to court because directives weren’t being followed.</span></p>

<p><span id="para544">Speaker, the government knew about the horrors 
happening in the halls of these homes because they were told by the 
experts and the staff on the front lines. Why? Why did you refuse to 
listen to them?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para545"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you for the question. We have been listening and taking action. 
When we look at the long-term-care homes, every operator and every home 
is required to meet the standards of care and to follow the directives 
of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. They are held to a standard that
 is not negotiable.</span></p>

<p><span id="para546">We have worked with our experts, our scientists, 
our medical officers of health, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and 
the assistant medical officer of health, and we have issued their 
directives and provided guidance. We did that very, very early—back in 
February. We have been working all along with our partners in long-term 
care. This must be a collaborative process.</span></p>

<p><span id="para547">The long-term-care ministry and the government of 
Ontario do not operate long-term-care homes. This is why that 
collaboration is so incredibly important. All the people who are doing 
the good work that’s necessary to move us past this horrible time, I 
value; I value that effort.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para549"><strong><span id="P562_144890">M<sup>me</sup> Lucille Collard:</span></strong>
 My question is for the Minister of Long-Term Care. Yesterday’s Canadian
 Armed Forces report on those five long-term-care residences is very 
alarming. We cannot tell ourselves that these are five isolated cases.</span></p>

<p><span id="para550">I wrote to the minister almost three weeks ago 
with alarming concerns about three long-term-care residences in my 
riding. I then urged the minister for immediate action, and I 
highlighted the concern that personal protective equipment was not being
 changed frequently enough to stop contamination, that there was 
insufficient staff, and that there were cockroach infestations. This is 
simply unacceptable.</span></p>

<p><span id="para551">Clearly, the traffic light—green, yellow, 
red—method is not working. We need to stop monitoring and we need to 
start following up on these reports. Can the minister commit to actually
 following up with every long-term-care residence that reports the need 
for any type of support?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para552"><strong><span id="P565_145916">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you for raising that. We have heard from you and others. That’s 
why we have an integrated system with Ontario Health and with local 
hospitals to be engaged in what’s going on in those long-term-care homes
 with their infection prevention and control teams.</span></p>

<p><span id="para553">What we need is an integrated system. That’s what 
our government has been doing with Ontario Health, the Ontario health 
teams, the integration of the acute care expertise infection control in 
our long-term-care homes, the rapid deployment teams and the SWAT teams.
 That is exactly what we have been doing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para554">It’s important to understand that this is not a 
normal time—all hands on deck. Everyone has to contribute; everyone has a
 role to play. We’ve been working with our partners and working with the
 teams that have come to support the home that you mentioned, and 
others. This must continue. This is an opportunity to say that our 
long-term-care system needs the support of our communities, our acute 
care centres, our research centres and our academic centres. This is 
absolutely critical and necessary.</span></p>

<p><span id="para555">I appreciate your voice in this. I appreciate all 
of your voices. We must emerge from this having supported our 
vulnerable. This must not be in vain.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para557"><strong>M<sup>me</sup> Lucille Collard:</strong>
 I want to emphasize the fact that this cannot wait. We cannot wait for 
an investigation into what’s happening in our long-term-care homes now. 
Seniors have been living in these horrible situations for too long now.</span></p>

<p><span id="para558">What will the minister do right now to ensure that
 no other long-term care is going through the same situation as the ones
 brought up in the Canadian Armed Forces report?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para559"><strong>Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</strong>
 Thank you again for the question. We’ve taken decisive actions over the
 last months with many ministries, in collaboration with the experts. We
 are doing that now, and we will continue to do that. This requires 
investigation, inspections that will require a lens to be put on this to
 understand how we move forward from this. It’s the infection control. 
It’s shoring up staffing. It’s making sure that everyone involved is 
accountable and responsible. I cannot be accountable for COVID, but I do
 take ownership of what is happening, and it’s incredibly important that
 we take ownership, that we solve these issues.</span></p>

<p><span id="para560">Looking at how we can support these homes that are
 in crisis—we continue to do that, whether it’s through SWAT teams, 
rapid deployment teams, working with Ontario Health, or working with 
public health. We will continue to do everything, including the 
military, and we are asking the military now to stay. We do need that 
federal support. We are asking the federal government to support us. 
It’s going to take all levels of government—everyone—to find the 
solutions going forward and to support our homes and our residents.</span></p>

<h3><span id="P574_149093"><span id="para561"><span id="P574_149128">Long-term care</span></span></span></h3>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para562"><strong><span id="P575_149177">Mrs. Jennifer (Jennie) Stevens:</span></strong>
 This is to the Premier. Long-term care is a serious issue for our 
veterans. The Royal Canadian Legion Ontario Command has been one of the 
louder voices to this government demanding a public inquiry into 
long-term care—on deaf ears. Now the long-term-care crisis is also 
affecting our Canadian Armed Forces members currently deployed in 
Ontario—35 members and counting. Not only have military personnel 
contracted the deadly COVID-19 while rescuing Ontario’s broken 
long-term-care system; now military sources have told reporters that 
they are truly worried about PTSD among the troops stationed here in 
Ontario long-term-care homes.</span></p>

<p><span id="para563">What does it say about the state of our 
long-term-care homes? Canada’s troops are trained to face combat all 
over the world, and they were traumatized by what they have found here 
in Ontario’s long-term-care homes. This government needs to listen to 
their voices, and an independent public inquiry must happen now. When 
will you say it will?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para564"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Minister of Long-Term Care.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para565"><strong><span id="P578_150355">Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:</span></strong>
 Thank you for the question. My heart goes out. I have great gratitude 
for the armed forces that have come in to support our homes. It was in 
our time of need, Ontario’s time of need, and they were there. I’ve said
 before: We are in a war against COVID-19. We are in a state of 
emergency, and for the armed forces to be there in Ontario’s time of 
need—I am very, very grateful for that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para566">An independent commission will have public 
hearings, it will have public input and it will have a public report, 
and that is the most expedient way that we can achieve the answers in a 
timely way. The Premier has said that everything is on the table. The 
Premier has been committed to this. I am committed to making sure that 
we move forward with the truth and understanding and transparency. This 
is not a time for politics. It is not a time for politicking. It is a 
time for care, compassion and transparency, and that is what we will do.
 We will move forward with that transparency.</span></p>

 I have a petition that was shared through our hospital, among 
front-line health care workers—it garnered the first hundreds of 
signatures in 48 hours, with an online version having already received 
40,000 signatures—calling for the $4 pandemic pay to be fairly 
distributed. It reads as follows:</span></p>

<p><span id="para749">“To the Legislative Assembly of Ontario:</span></p>

<p><span id="para750">“Whereas the Ontario government has announced the 
temporary pandemic pay in recognition of the dedication, long hours and 
increased risk of working to contain the COVID-19 outbreak;</span></p>

<p><span id="para751">“Whereas this increase will provide $4 per hour 
worked on top of existing hourly wages, regardless of the qualified 
employee’s hourly wage. In addition, employees working over 100 hours 
per month would receive lump sum payments of $250 per month for each of 
the next four months;</span></p>

<p><span id="para752">“Whereas those eligible to receive the payment 
will be staff working in long-term-care homes, retirement homes, 
emergency shelters, supportive housing, social services congregate care 
settings, correction institutions and youth justice facilities, as well 
as those providing home and community care and staff in hospitals;</span></p>

<p><span id="para753">“Whereas staff providing front-line clinical 
services along with those providing support services will be eligible to
 receive the pandemic payment;</span></p>

<p><span id="para754">“Whereas it is vital that front-line health care 
providers are retained as together we continue our fight to stop the 
spread of COVID-19; and</span></p>

<p><span id="para755">“Whereas the Ontario government remains committed 
to using every resource it has to support the front-line workers as we 
work to stop the spread of COVID-19;</span></p>

<p><span id="para762">Resuming the debate adjourned on May 27, 2020, on the motion relating to certain House proceedings and committee business.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para763"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> When we last debated this item, the member for London West had the floor. Again, I recognize the member for London West.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para764"><strong><span id="P785_166216">Ms. Peggy Sattler:</span></strong>
 I started my comments this morning with an observation about the change
 of tone that we have experienced in this Legislature over the last 
couple of days. We came here in the midst of a pandemic to talk about 
being one team—“There’s no blue team, orange team, red team or green 
team; we are one team”—and yet we have seen over the last two days a 
complete lack of collaboration, a complete lack of respect for the role 
of the official opposition.</span></p>

<p><span id="para765">Speaker, I have to address what we witnessed in 
this Legislature this morning in terms of a lack of respect for the 
staff who work in this place, a lack of respect for all of the members 
who have come in the midst of the pandemic to deal with very, very 
important public policy issues. We had a vote where the government 
members came in in full. They completely ignored any rules about 
physical distancing that we had agreed to. We had agreed to those rules 
when we first came back here in March, when we came back here in April, 
when we came back here earlier in May. This government decided to 
completely and flagrantly ignore those protocols that we had all agreed 
were important not just for the safety of the people who work in this 
place and for us as members, but to model the expectations and the 
behaviours that we are hoping Ontarians continue to observe. Public 
health is at risk. If we do not continue to observe physical distancing,
 to maintain two metres’ distance from each other, we are risking the 
health of others and our own health. When we all go back to our home 
communities, we go back to our families and we go back to our 
constituents, we don’t want to be risking their health because of the 
display that we saw here today. I felt that that was more important 
context to be provided in terms of the debate on the motion that we are 
looking at today.</span></p>

<p><span id="para766">When I concluded my remarks in the morning, I was 
just reviewing the bills that are going to be addressed in this motion. 
Bill 156 is scheduled for public hearings. That’s the bill on 
biosecurity, otherwise known as the ag gag laws. Major, major concerns 
raised about freedom of speech, freedom of expression—court challenges 
in other jurisdictions that have been upheld, that these kinds of laws 
infringe on people’s constitutional freedoms. This is one of the bills 
that this government thinks should be dealt with in a couple of weeks—on
 June 8 and 9: two days of public hearings.</span></p>

<p><span id="para767">They are also looking at bringing in Bill 171, a 
bill that deals with building transit in the city of Toronto. My 
goodness, Speaker, there is a need for transit in the city of Toronto, 
but transit agencies are dealing with a complete collapse of fare 
revenues. They are dealing with a plummeting of ridership because of the
 pandemic and because of concerns about what’s going to happen when they
 ride mass transit systems.</span></p>

<p><span id="para768">When people want to talk about transit, those are 
the kinds of things they want to talk about. How are we going to even 
ensure that we are able to continue operating the transit systems that 
we already have in place? I know that in my community, in London, the 
London Transit Commission announced that their budget won’t take them 
past June unless there’s some kind of major budgetary investment from 
the city—a city that is already looking at an over $30-million budget 
hole as a result of COVID-19 measures.</span></p>

<p><span id="para769">So let’s talk about transit, but let’s talk about 
how we are going to keep transit operating in this province. How are we 
going to help the TTC dig out of the enormous revenue hole that it has 
found itself in as a result of COVID-19? These are the kinds of 
questions that people are asking. When this bill is called before public
 hearings, if this motion passes—June 8, 9 and 10—I expect that we’ll be
 hearing about that. I expect that when people come to talk about 
building transit faster in Toronto, they’re going to want to talk about 
how we are going to maintain the transit that we already have.</span></p>

<p><span id="para770">The other bill that is outlined in this motion 
deals with home care: Bill 175. Again, that is proposed to come forward 
for three days of public hearings: June 15, 16 and 17. Every member on 
the official opposition side who spoke to that bill emphasized the fact 
that the glaring omission in the bill is any reference to what to do 
about PSWs, personal support workers. You can’t have a home care system 
if you don’t have a sufficient supply of personal support workers.</span></p>

<p><span id="para771">From what we have heard from the beginning of this
 crisis, from the PSWs who have contacted all of our offices to tell us 
about their working conditions, the lack of support, the lack of PPE, 
the insecurity of their jobs, cobbling together part-time jobs at a 
number of different agencies or care homes because there is no full-time
 employment, we know there are no benefits and the wages are deplorable.
 And this government had decided that it was going to limit all public 
sector workers to 1%. So you’re talking about PSWs who already earned 
barely above the minimum wage, and this government wants to reward them 
with a 1% increase, Speaker.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para772">1310</span></p>

<p><span id="para773">If we want to have a home care system that 
actually helps support people’s health and well-being, we need to ensure
 that the workers are there to provide that assistance. We need to make 
the career of a PSW rewarding. We need to provide the training and 
supports that they need so that they can provide the care that they want
 to provide. I recognize that this is a very difficult time for this 
government, and maybe that’s part of what we’ve seen over the last two 
days. They are on the hot seat, Speaker, for one of the most damning, 
scathing reports, I think, ever issued in the province of Ontario. It 
talked about horrifying, horrifying conditions in the long-term-care 
homes that were right under the noses of this government for the last 
two years—right under their noses—and yet it took the military being 
called in before these horrific abuses were uncovered.</span></p>

<p><span id="para774">I know it’s not easy to be accountable for the 
issues that were described in that report, but this is a government that
 has been in office for more than two years and, Speaker, they have to 
take some accountability. They have to take accountability for the fact 
that only nine inspections were conducted of the 262 long-term-care 
homes in the province—because they thought that that was a more 
efficient use of public dollars, to end the inspections of 
long-term-care homes. And look where it got us. Yet they want to talk 
about a bill, they want to bring forward a bill that’s going to 
completely upend the delivery of home care in this province, a system 
that has already been completely privatized by the Liberals and that 
relies on PSWs. They think that that’s a good thing to do as they’re 
dealing with this complete chaos in the long-term-care system.</span></p>

<p><span id="para775">We know from reports that the Ontario Health 
Coalition has issued, we know from the report we got from the military, 
from the military’s investigation of those five long-term-care homes, 
that the ownership of these care systems has to be looked at, that when 
you have a privatized system of care for elderly or vulnerable people, 
then people are more likely to get hurt, people are more likely to die. 
That is what the Ontario Health Coalition’s research showed, Speaker, 
when they looked at results, in terms of COVID-19 cases, in homes that 
were owned by private owners and homes that were public or municipally 
owned. So Speaker, I don’t think this is the time to be embarking on 
this major overhaul of privatized home care, and yet this government 
thinks that this is a wise thing to do, to bring forward this bill for 
three days of public hearings in June.</span></p>

<p><span id="para776">The other bill that the government wants to 
address is Bill 161. That’s the legal aid bill. Again, they want to 
bring that one forward for three days of public hearings in June. 
Speaker, let me tell you about some of the supports that legal aid 
provides for the most vulnerable people in Ontario. I think many of us 
have come to know Jane Meadus, for example. She’s from the legal aid 
Advocacy Centre for the Elderly, and she’s been a very vocal and 
outspoken advocate for elderly people, for seniors who are living in 
these horrendous conditions in our long-term-care homes, and thank 
goodness. Thank goodness for the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly, for 
being a voice for seniors who have been completely ignored and neglected
 by this government and the Liberals before them.</span></p>

<p><span id="para777">We also know that legal aid funds the ARCH 
Disability Law Centre, another very important voice for people who are 
the most marginalized and disproportionately negatively impacted by 
COVID-19. People with disabilities are struggling with lack of access to
 housing, lack of access to employment, food insecurity, lack of access 
to public transit. Transit system routes are being cancelled. Many don’t
 have vehicles, and yet they are no longer able to access public 
transportation.</span></p>

<p><span id="para778">Legal aid also funds the Income Security Advocacy 
Centre, another very important organization that provides policy 
recommendations to ensure that the most marginalized in our society are 
supported, that we have public policies in place that will lift people 
out of poverty, that will support people in moving forward in employment
 or education and enable them to live a decent life.</span></p>

<p><span id="para779">Legal aid also funds the Injured Workers Community
 Legal Clinic. In the context of COVID-19, when we have heard over and 
over about workers who have been fearful for their health and safety on 
the job because of the lack of PPE, the lack of employer support 
modifications to businesses etc.—workers are being forced to go back to 
work, are being called back to work. They have no options, in many 
cases. They are very anxious about what’s going to happen to their 
health when they go into a workplace that does not have adequate safety 
measures. We know that over 200 people went to the Ministry of Labour 
and asked for an investigation, and so far, every single one of the 
investigations that has been launched with the Ministry of Labour to 
look at unsafe workplace conditions has been declined.</span></p>

<p><span id="para780">Earlier this morning, I talked about the fact that
 the government is not including Thursdays as one of the days that the 
Legislature will be recalled. Thursday, of course, is the day when we 
deal with private members’ bills. We talked about some of the important 
policies that have been advanced through private members’ legislation in
 this House. My colleague the MPP for Niagara Falls has a private 
member’s bill on the docket right now that would guarantee presumptive 
COVID-19-related WSIB coverage. That is an important bill. I can’t think
 of anything that would be more relevant in the context of the pandemic 
that we are dealing with than that bill, but there won’t be an 
opportunity under this proposal to address that. There won’t be an 
opportunity to address any other private members’ bills or motions or 
policy ideas that members on all sides of the House may have to help the
 government, to work with the government to benefit the people of this 
province. All of us are hearing from the people we represent about some 
of the changes they believe need to be made, some of the challenges that
 they’re dealing with in light of COVID-19. We will have no opportunity 
to bring those ideas forward in private members’ public business, and 
that is a huge loss for the people of this province.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para781">1320</span></p>

<p><span id="para782">I also wanted to talk a little bit about the 
timelines that are set out in this bill for consideration of these four 
pieces of legislation. We have seen this before—when we go through the 
process of having days put aside for public input and then the 
government gives 24 hours to turn around amendments to the legislation 
for consideration. I have always been concerned that this does not 
provide due process. It does not provide the time that is required to 
actually reflect on the input that is received and turn that input 
around into amendments. When the timelines are so tight, when the 
timelines between the final day for written input and the day for 
amendments to be submitted—it doesn’t really allow for the public’s 
voice to be heard because it limits our opportunity to go through the 
public input that was received, both in presentation form or in written 
form, and identify what the amendments are that would really make a 
difference.</span></p>

<p><span id="para783">In this motion we have very tight timelines for 
public hearings, very tight timelines for the turnaround from the 
deadline for written submissions and the submission of amendments for 
consideration to the bill, and that’s a problem. That is a real problem.
 If we are actually interested in hearing from the people of this 
province, we wouldn’t create timelines like that. We would allow an 
appropriate opportunity for consideration of the input that was heard 
and turn that into amendments to improve and strengthen the bill.</span></p>

<p><span id="para784">The other issue is that the government is 
proposing that all of the public hearings on the four bills that will be
 brought forward will be held in Toronto. Now, the first bill that is 
outlined in this motion, Bill 156, which deals with biosecurity and 
protection of farm animals—the fact that this government expects people 
who may have a strong interest in this legislation, a strong interest in
 what is needed to protect Ontario’s farms—this government is expecting 
farmers to come to Toronto in early June, in planting season. I don’t 
think that is a good way to enable the participation of the people who 
are closest to the legislation.</span></p>

<p><span id="para785">I know that originally public hearings for this 
bill were planned in other areas of the province. London was one of the 
locations for those hearings, and I can tell you I’m aware of quite a 
few Londoners who were looking forward to the opportunity to present to 
that committee. In the agricultural community in Middlesex county, which
 surrounds London, there are a lot of people who are involved in 
agriculture who were looking forward to the opportunity to come and 
present to committee. I know that the government couldn’t prevent the 
cancellation of those public hearings; I understand why those public 
hearings had to be cancelled. But now, to reschedule them and to hold 
them only in Toronto is really disrespectful to the people who the 
government should want to want to hear from. The government should want 
to hear from agricultural workers, without expecting them to travel vast
 distances to come into Toronto to participate in these public hearings.</span></p>

<p><span id="para786">Now, I do understand that there’s going to be a 
virtual process. We don’t have any information on what that’s going to 
look like, what the requirements will be for presenters to participate 
in that virtual process because, as I pointed out earlier this morning, 
the virtual process has never been tried before. We are going to be 
running four virtual processes almost simultaneously on four very 
substantive and, frankly, contentious pieces of legislation, and that’s a
 problem.</span></p>

<p><span id="para787">With that, I would like to move an amendment to the motion.</span></p>

<p><span id="para788">I move that the motion be amended by striking out 
“Tuesdays and Wednesdays” in the second paragraph and replacing it with 
“Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays”; and</span></p>

<p><span id="para789">By striking out “Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays”
 in the third paragraph and replacing it with “Mondays, Tuesdays, 
Wednesdays and Thursdays”; and</span></p>

<p><span id="para790">By deleting everything following “once all deferred votes have been taken; and”.</span></p>

<p><span id="para791">I will give the amendment—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para792"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong>
 Ms. Sattler has moved that the motion be amended by striking out 
“Tuesdays and Wednesdays” in the second paragraph and replacing it with 
“Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays”; and</span></p>

<p><span id="para793">By striking out “Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays”
 in the third paragraph and replacing it with “Mondays, Tuesdays, 
Wednesdays and Thursdays”; and</span></p>

<p><span id="para794">By deleting everything following “once all deferred votes have been taken; and”.</span></p>

<p><span id="para795">I’ll recognize again the member for London West to continue the debate, now on the amendment.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para796"><strong>Ms. Peggy Sattler:</strong>
 Yes. Thank you very much, Speaker. This amendment, I think, 
demonstrates the official opposition’s commitment to working on behalf 
of the people of this province. We not only want to be here two days a 
week in June; we want to be here three days a week. We want to be here 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. In July, we don’t just want to be 
here three days a week; we want to be here four days a week. We want to 
work on behalf of the people of this province.</span></p>

<p><span id="para797">The amendment that I have proposed, by including 
Thursdays in both June and July, will enable the consideration of 
private members’ motions and private members’ bills. As I have already 
pointed out in my remarks, these are important opportunities. Private 
members’ public business is fundamental to the democratic process. It 
reflects our rights, our privileges, our obligations as representatives 
of the people who elected us to come to this place. We know that many 
private members’ bills or private members’ motions originate from an 
issue that we have learned about in our riding. They originate from a 
constituent who has brought our attention to a gap or a problem that can
 be fixed through legislation. That, Speaker, is the logic behind the 
first two parts of the amendment. We want to work. We want to work hard 
on behalf of the people we represent and work hard on behalf of the 
people in this province.</span></p>

<p><span id="para798">The third part of the amendment calls for the 
deletion of the four bills that are identified in this motion. We 
believe that now is the time for this Legislature to be looking at 
legislation that addresses COVID-19-related issues. We had a consensus. 
We had an agreement among all the parties that that was going to be our 
focus, that this is what we were going to be doing as the Legislature 
resumed. So to see a motion that doesn’t provide any opportunity for 
consideration of COVID-19-related bills, that simply rams through some 
leftover items of this government’s agenda—an agenda, frankly, that has 
failed the people of this province, an agenda that cut millions of 
dollars from public health, compromised our ability to respond to this 
pandemic, an agenda that eliminated inspections in long-term-care 
homes—this is the kind of agenda that this government is narrowly 
focused on pushing through, and that’s a problem for us.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para799">1330</span></p>

<p><span id="para800">We want to be here. We want to be talking about 
the priorities that we’re hearing about in our communities. We look 
forward to working with this government on legislation that’s going to 
address those priorities.</span></p>

<p><span id="para801">We would hope that the government would be 
interested in hearing from us, hearing our views on actions that could 
be taken to support Ontarians who are struggling with the impact of 
COVID-19; for example, a commercial rent subsidy. That is something that
 we would be very interested in working with the government on. We know 
that they believe the program that they’ve put in place is just 
great—“Let’s not rush to judgment on it. Let’s see how it’s working.” 
Well, we know it is not working. All of us have been hearing from 
businesses in our communities that they can’t stay afloat and cannot see
 a way to survive to the end of this pandemic. They are facing huge 
fixed costs, of rent that has to continue to be paid, of utilities that 
have to continue to be paid. In my riding of London West, many of them 
don’t have enough staff that would qualify them to apply for the federal
 wage subsidy. They’re not getting anything. They have landlords who 
don’t want to participate in the commercial rent program. They are 
desperate. I know that we have all heard those stories of desperate 
businesses. That is something we could be talking about on a Thursday in
 private members’ public business—about bringing in some meaningful rent
 relief for businesses in this province so that they don’t go under, so 
that we still have an economy to return to once we get through this 
pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span id="para802">We could also be talking about the implementation 
of some of those fixes in long-term care that need to be taken now. We 
have been very clear that a public inquiry does not mean putting off 
decisions about changes that need to be made until the inquiry is 
reported a couple of years down the road—an independent, transparent, 
fully public inquiry, under the Public Inquiries Act—that can identify 
right away the changes that need to be made now, the legislative changes
 that might need to be implemented to support it. That legislation could
 be brought in over June and July. We could move quickly to address some
 of the appalling abuses of our seniors in the five long-term-care homes
 that were supported by the military. Unfortunately, I don’t think any 
of us believe that there were only five. Unfortunately, there were only 
five that the military went into. It is very, very concerning to think 
about the conditions that our frail elderly are living in in those other
 257 long-term-care homes that the military didn’t go into.</span></p>

<p><span id="para803">Speaker, these are the opportunities we have 
before us to be nimble, to be responsive, to really address the 
priorities that people in this province have identified, the things that
 they want all of us to be working together on, and to bring in 
legislation initiatives to deal with those things.</span></p>

<p><span id="para804">I have not received a single email from somebody 
who wants to know, “When will Bill 171 go forward on the public agenda?”
 “When will Bill 175”—Bill 175, again, is the home care act. If 
anything, I have received emails from people who are very concerned 
about home care. They do not see Bill 175 as the solution.</span></p>

<p><span id="para805">I heard from vulnerable people who were receiving 
services from a PSW. The private agency that the PSW worked for was not 
requiring that PSW to wear PPE when they went in to support that 
constituent. Meanwhile, that PSW may have been going into 20 different 
homes in a week and all the while not wearing masks, not wearing gloves 
and exposing very, very vulnerable people to potential COVID-19 
infection. I don’t fault the PSW. The PSW was absolutely working under 
the rules that the private sector agency had established, and that PSW 
was failed by those rules. Those vulnerable constituents were failed by 
the lack of protection for that worker and for themselves.</span></p>

<p><span id="para806">Speaker, I would love to be looking at paid sick 
days. We saw the Premiers of BC, Manitoba and Yukon release a statement 
about how excited they were about working with the federal government to
 implement those 10 paid sick days. We haven’t heard a thing from this 
government about when workers in this province are going to be protected
 with paid sick days. In fact, they say that that’s politicizing, that 
it’s being political, asking when Ontario workers can expect to see paid
 sick days. That’s not political; that is good public policy. That is 
what workers in this province need and expect from us.</span></p>

<p><span id="para807">Speaker, I hope that people support my motion. I will conclude my remarks now.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para808"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para809"><strong><span id="P830_190945">Hon. Paul Calandra:</span></strong>
 I appreciate the opportunity to get up and rise today and talk a little
 bit about the motion that was put forward by the government and just 
only briefly touch on the amendment by the opposition—in the sense that 
what the amendment does, really, is expose the Jekyll and Hyde that has 
become the NDP of today.</span></p>

<p><span id="para810">Let me explain that, Mr. Speaker. The public face 
of the NDP is that they want to work, yhey want to be in this chamber. 
The non-public face of the NDP is, “We need to adjourn this place on 
June 3 and get out of here as quickly as possible”—because that’s what 
the discussion has been about for weeks.</span></p>

<p><span id="para811">What we have done, what the government has done, 
is we said, “Look, this House is supposed to adjourn on June 3, but as 
opposed to adjourning on June 3, we are going to keep the Legislature in
 session. We’re going to keep the Legislature in session to deal with 
important public matters—COVID-19, yes, but other issues that are 
important to the people of Ontario—so that we can continue to have an 
economy, or bring back an economy, that has suffered through COVID-19.” 
That’s the reality.</span></p>

<p><span id="para812">Now, I appreciate that the NDP would love not to 
debate the items that are on the legislative agenda. They’re the 
official opposition, and I appreciate the fact that it would be in their
 interest for the government not to move forward with an agenda. Of 
course, they would want the government not to move forward with an 
agenda, but we have an agenda that we were elected by the people of the 
province of Ontario to fulfill, and we will do that because it’s in the 
best interests of the people of the province of Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para813">Interjections.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para814"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> The opposition will come to order.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para815"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong>
 Obviously, Mr. Speaker, we always touch a nerve when we call out the 
NDP. Then what happens, then you get the catcalling back and forth and 
the heckling. They get really upset because what happens is that the 
members on this side of the House touch a nerve with them when they’re 
called out for the inconsistencies of their messaging.</span></p>

<p><span id="para816">The member opposite, the deputy opposition House 
leader, earlier—just now—talked about the horror that all the members 
had to come in and vote in the fashion that we did. I want to, just if I
 can go back to prior to question period today, when I rose in this 
place and sought unanimous consent, after having provided the motion in 
advance to the opposition—it was, “Mr. Speaker, I move that for any 
recorded division today members may rise and be counted from the public 
galleries.” Just so people at home are aware, the public galleries—not 
the floor of the Legislative Assembly, but the galleries that surround 
the floor, which would have allowed for members to social distance, 
which would have allowed for the scene that we saw today not to happen. 
The NDP said no, they would not give consent for the Legislature to vote
 in that fashion, Mr. Speaker.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para817">1340</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para818"><strong>Interjections:</strong> Shame.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para819"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong> And why?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para820"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Order.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para821"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong>
 I don’t know why, but that is something that they’ll have to explain to
 the people of the province of Ontario. We had to have our vote passed.</span></p>

<p><span id="para822">I want to just raise a couple of things that are 
top of mind because she talked about this. She talked about committees 
and how farmers are going to have to come to the city of Toronto, in 
particular, on the farm trespass bill. Well, that’s just simply not 
accurate. It’s just simply not accurate. In fact, it really, again, 
highlights just how antiquated today’s NDP are, just how in the past 
they are. I know—I can’t speak to the colleagues opposite—that the 
members of this caucus have been on Zoom and other communication methods
 and video conferencing, day in and day out, since this began. They’ve 
been on their telephones, they’ve been reaching out to people in a way 
that I, as a House leader and as a member who has been both here for a 
bit and federally—I can’t be even more proud than I am of this caucus 
for all of the work that they have done.</span></p>

<p><span id="para823">But we also understand that they have a role to 
play. The opposition has a role to play. That is their job. They are the
 official opposition. One of the most important parts of a parliamentary
 system is that the government is held accountable for the decisions 
that it makes. Now, we could do what the NDP and Liberals in Ottawa have
 done and bring down Parliament in a secret deal. We could do that. We 
have a majority. But we said no. What we said instead was that we would 
come back to this Legislature, we would deal with COVID-19 issues and we
 will deal with other issues that are important to the people of 
Ontario. Because we have to be ready when we come out of this COVID-19 
pandemic. Our economy has to be ready. Our transit and transportation 
systems have to be ready. Now is not the time for the people of the 
province of Ontario or their government or their Parliament to simply 
put its hands up in the air and wash themselves, absolve themselves, of 
any responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span id="para824">We are in a very fortunate spot here. We’re very 
lucky. Unlike the millions of people who are unemployed, who are faced 
with having their CERB or their other supports taken away from them, the
 people who are losing jobs, the stores that might be closing on our 
main streets, every single one of us has continued to get a paycheque, 
and I know on this side of the House, every single one of these members 
behind me have earned that. But they don’t forget for a second how 
privileged they are that the people of the province of Ontario continue 
to pay them, and we don’t earn that trust by washing our hands of a 
crisis, by washing our hands of an economy that needs our help, by 
washing our hands of the main streets and the small and medium and large
 enterprises that need our help. And we’re going to sit here in this 
place and we’re going to do that, Mr. Speaker. That’s important to us. 
It’s important to our constituents.</span></p>

<p><span id="para825">She talked about private members’ business. We 
showed yesterday that we actually don’t need a Thursday to deal with 
private members’ business. We took government time and we dealt with 
private members’ business. Go figure, Mr. Speaker, that we can find time
 on the schedule to deal with private members’ business.</span></p>

<p><span id="para826">Interjections.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para827"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong>
 Now, I’m hearing some of the members opposite chuckle, “Well, it’s 
government legislation.” That didn’t stop them—it’s a private member’s 
bill—</span></p>

<p><span id="para828">Interjection.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para829"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Member for Waterloo, come to order.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para830"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong>
 —and the member for Eglinton–Lawrence did really good work on this. But
 that didn’t stop them for the last, I don’t know, what, six, seven 
hours, taking credit for it, saying how they worked with us, to bring it
 forward. To their credit, they did work with us and that’s why we took 
government time to deal with a private member’s business, and we can do 
that, coming forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para831">She talks about how we should work together. We 
have done nothing but try to work with the NDP since this broke. In 
fact, again, the member for—is it Kitchener?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para832"><strong>Ms. Catherine Fife:</strong> Waterloo.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para833"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong> Waterloo. She chuckles and laughs—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para834"><strong>Ms. Catherine Fife:</strong> Yes, I’m laughing at you.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para835"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong>
 —but the deputy House leader of the opposition will know that she has 
spent hours on Zoom with me, the House leader for the Liberals, the 
leader of the Green Party, my deputy House leader—literally hours—as we 
negotiated elements of every single thing that we did here, every single
 thing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para836">Mr. Speaker, I want to go back, if I can, to May 
11. On May 11, we brought forward—I guess it was May 12. We brought 
forward some extensive legislation in this House that passed with 
unanimous support. In order to get to that, we spent over seven hours on
 Zoom together. I brought in over 40 officials, public officials from 
the public service, to talk about the legislation that we wanted to 
bring forward, to give them the opportunity to see it, to talk about it,
 to make comments about it. Not only was the deputy opposition House 
leader on, not only was the House leader for the opposition on the call,
 but members of the Leader of the Opposition’s staff were on the call, 
the critics were on the call, and they had suggestions. In fact, part of
 those suggestions was that two of the bills that we wanted to proceed 
with should be taken off the order paper and debated at a future date in
 time. We did that. But what did the Leader of the Opposition say? I can
 tell you what she said, Mr. Speaker. I’m not going to read the whole 
thing, but she said—</span></p>

<p><span id="para837">Interjection.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para838"><strong>Hon. Paul Calandra:</strong> It’s not actually confidential, because she said it when asked by the press about working with the government.</span></p>

<p><span id="para839">She said, “Up until now, we’ve had no indication 
from the government of what kind of bill”—this is the day 
before—“they’re going to be introducing in the House tomorrow. Again, I 
mean, I think that that’s something that didn’t have to go that way. 
I’ve not spoken to the Premier once. He hasn’t picked up the phone.” 
Well, we know that not to be the case.</span></p>

<p><span id="para840">She goes on to say, “Unfortunately, you know, 
other than the negotiations of the nuts and bolts of how the sessions 
are going to happen when we come back into the House, we have not been 
overly engaged by the government in the legislation they want to bring 
forward.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para841">I guess the only thing I can surmise from that is 
that the opposition House leaders are not explaining to them that they 
actually negotiated the withdrawal of two bills from the package, that 
when they gave us unanimous consent on every single bill that we brought
 forward up until this point, including a financial statement, they just
 simply hadn’t read any of it. They must not have known, Mr. Speaker—or 
the Leader of the Opposition’s own staff, who sat in on these meetings 
and helped negotiate some of these bills, simply didn’t tell their 
leader. That’s the only thing I can surmise. Why would the Leader of the
 Opposition undermine all of the hard work that was done not only by 
members on this side, but members of her own caucus, members of the 
people on her own team, the leader of the Green Party and the House 
leader for the Liberal Party, and then come out and say this every 
single time?</span></p>

<p><span id="para842">Just last week, colleagues, we allowed an 
opposition day motion to come into this place, because we know it’s 
important that the opposition has an opportunity to speak on things that
 are important to them. In that agreement—“Don’t worry, we only want 70 
minutes to speak to it, and then we can get out of here and go on and do
 other things that are important.” Part of that agreement was that I 
would sit down my members after two speeches to allow them to go on for 
70 minutes. Later on in the day, when they took it right through to the 
end of the day—“Oops, sorry. My bad.” That is the spirit in which the 
NDP has been moving since March, since we left this place. They have had
 to be shamed every step of the way.</span></p>

<p><span id="para843">To their credit, on most of those instances, they 
finally came around because they knew the public would not tolerate the 
types of behaviour that we see behind the scenes, when the Jekyll and 
Hyde comes through. And then of course, when they’re in public, they say
 one thing—it’s outrage that members have to come in and vote—but when 
they think nobody is listening, they deny unanimous consent for the 
members of this House to vote in the public galleries, in a way that is 
safe to all people, and then feign surprise that, hey, we want to pass 
the legislation that is important to us.</span></p>

<p><span id="para844">She talks about the importance of debate. They 
allowed two bills to pass yesterday. They didn’t have enough people who 
wanted to speak to these bills, debate collapsed and we were able to 
move forward to a vote today. They talk about the bills that are on the 
order paper. There are a number of bills that are on the order paper. 
We’re proud of some of these bills. They don’t like some of them, but 
they don’t want to debate them. They don’t want to debate them.</span></p>

<p><span id="para845">When you look at farm trespass, there have already
 been—it was introduced 177 days ago. There have been over 22 speeches; 
24 other members have participated in questions and answers. On Smarter 
and Stronger Justice—170 days on the order paper, 23 speeches; 28 
members have participated in debate on that. Bill 171: 22 members have 
provided speeches; 39 others have participated in debate on that. Bill 
175, introduced 92 days ago: 27 members have spoken to it; 24 members 
have participated in debate. Bill 159, 174 days ago: 14 people have 
spoken to it; 23 members have participated in debate. If I’m not 
mistaken, that bill was sent to committee after first reading so that 
people could comment on what they heard, and it was so well received 
that we couldn’t fill the committee days.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para846">1350</span></p>

<p><span id="para847">In fact, that’s been the case on a lot of the 
bills that we have been bringing forward recently. We are unable to fill
 the committee days because the bills have been done properly. It is not
 my job to help the opposition do its job. I can only surmise that when 
they can’t speak to bills in the length of time we are providing, they 
are supportive of the measures that we are doing. It’s not my job to 
help them do their job; it’s my job, as the government House leader, to 
help the government move forward its agenda. That’s what we are doing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para848">We can move forward an agenda on the economy, we 
can move forward an agenda on long-term care, we can move forward an 
agenda on health care, and we can move forward an agenda that sees our 
supports for our small, medium and large enterprises move forward. We 
can see an agenda that helps our cultural and tourism communities that 
are desperate for our help and advice. We can do that while still 
continuing to do the people’s business in this place. Our example should
 not be what happened in Ottawa: Cave in and go away. That’s not what 
we’re going to do here. We’re going to pass the people’s business 
because they’ve told us that they want us to do that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para849">Mr. Speaker, in the motion that we are debating 
today there are important measures that will allow all members of this 
place to vote, because we recognize the fact that people in the 
opposition might not necessarily be supportive of the bills that we have
 brought forward. We do not think it’s appropriate that a majority 
government dictates to the opposition, to the members of this 
Legislature, what you can or can’t vote for.</span></p>

<p><span id="para850">So what we’ve done is created a system that will 
allow all of the members of this Legislature to come in and vote on 
bills, by creating a “yea” lobby and a “nay” lobby for voting, in much 
the same way that the mother Parliament does in the United Kingdom, and 
staggering votes over a half-hour time period. You will have a half hour
 to make your way, if you’re in support of a bill, into the government 
lobby; if you’re opposed to a bill, into the opposition lobby. You will 
have a half hour so that we can respect physical distancing, so that 
what happened today doesn’t happen again; so that the government doesn’t
 have to be reliant on the opposition to give us unanimous consent to 
vote in a way that I think the people of province of Ontario would 
expect, and so that the government doesn’t decide who the 15 members on 
that side are who can come in and vote against something and who the 25 
members on this side are who will come in and vote for something.</span></p>

<p><span id="para851">We’re collecting our paycheques; we should be here
 doing this work. That’s what the people of the province of Ontario 
expect, Mr. Speaker, and we are going to find ways to make sure that we 
do that. If July 23 isn’t enough, then we’ll come back and do more, 
because that’s our job. If it means that we have to vote in this fashion
 until December, then that’s how we will do it, because it is completely
 inappropriate and unacceptable that some people think that I as a House
 leader or the opposition House leader should decide which one of these 
members should come in here and vote on Bill 177.</span></p>

<p><span id="para852">I can tell you that all of my members want to have
 a say on Bill 177. All of my members want to have a say on transit and 
transportation issues. All of my members want to talk about the great 
things that have been happening in their communities, despite the fact 
that we are dealing with a global pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span id="para853">I reference the member for Mississauga–Lakeshore, 
who has been spending not only hours of time on the phone and on Zoom 
meetings with us, but has spent an enormous amount of time delivering 
meals, not only into his own riding but into communities—all of us have 
had that opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span id="para854">The member for Scarborough–Rouge Park, who was 
fighting hard to find a way so that we could visit the zoo in a way that
 was respectful and allowed social distancing—you know what? We’re able 
to do that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para855">All of the members in this place have been meeting
 with their chambers of commerce, and, I can tell you, there’s not one 
chamber of commerce that has turned to me and said, “Yes, it’s all 
right. Don’t worry about us. Adjourn the House until September.” You 
know what they’ve said? We’ve seen this with the Standing Committee on 
Finance that is coming up. You talk about co-operation. What did the 
government do on that? We actually expanded the committee so that it 
would include the leader of the Green Party and it would include a 
member of the Liberal Party. We added an independent to the 
subcommittee. We added members of the official opposition to the 
subcommittee. We had unanimous consent in public—in public—for how 
SCOFEA, the Standing Committee on Finance, would work. So one would 
think, given the unanimous consent, that that committee would be up and 
running. Well, it’s not, Mr. Speaker, and I can give you one guess as to
 why it’s not. It certainly isn’t the members on this side and it’s not 
the independent members. That’s not why that committee isn’t up and 
running right now listening to people in the tourism industry. That’s 
not why that committee is not running and talking about culture or 
hearing from the Minister of Finance, like we agreed to do. We agreed to
 bring the Minister of Finance. That committee should be up and running.</span></p>

<p><span id="para856">I have every confidence that this Legislative 
Assembly can actually put together meetings online so that people from 
across the province—whether they’re in my riding, whether they’re in 
Kenora or anywhere else—if they want to speak to one of these bills, 
they will have an opportunity this summer to talk to their legislators, 
the people who they’re paying to do this work, to give their advice. 
They’ll have more time to do it because that’s the commitment that we 
have made. They’ll have more time to do it. I have every confidence in 
this Legislature and the people who have brought us here and allow us to
 do this work that we’ll be able to do this, and that the people of 
Ontario will be satisfied to know that their members of Parliament are 
working very hard, and that we have not just given up. We’ve said just 
the opposite.</span></p>

<p><span id="para857">Not only are we going to beat this pandemic, but 
when we come out of it, Ontario will be stronger than ever before. This 
Legislature will have done its job, and we won’t take the example of the
 NDP or anybody else. We will sit, we will do our job, because that’s 
what people are paying us to do, and we are grateful to the people of 
the province of Ontario for giving us the opportunity to do it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para858">Interjections.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para859"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> I would ask the members to take their seats.</span></p>

<p><span id="para860">Further debate.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para861"><strong><span id="P882_212558">Ms. Teresa J. Armstrong:</span></strong>
 It’s my privilege to follow the government House leader today, and I 
don’t know what to say in some ways because he just always seems 
cantankerous in this Legislature. I think, what is in his cornflakes in 
the morning that he has to come into this Legislature and constantly 
just assume that we aren’t here to assist—maybe because we have a 
different way of doing it. It’s not always what you want when you want 
it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para862">He gives the examples, and we’ve all talked about 
this, about how this week, or yesterday, we brought legislation forward 
and it was passed etc. The difference is—and I don’t know what he’s 
thinking and why he would operate this way—we weren’t given any advance 
notice as to what they wanted to debate. And then to say things such as 
we didn’t want to debate it—people do need preparation time. It’s been a
 long time. We’ve all been home dealing with the pandemic on Zoom, 
online, on teleconferences 24 hours a day, seven days a week—all of us. 
All of us have been doing that work. We haven’t been sitting and not 
working. None of us have been doing that. We all come here in the spirit
 of being servants to the public. That means when we’re not sitting, 
even when there isn’t a pandemic, when we’re in our ridings, we aren’t 
on break. We’re not on vacation. We’re actually serving the people who 
elected us to be here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para863">Sometimes the things that he speaks about—again, I
 don’t even know how to comment on them, other than he is someone who’s 
generally painting a picture that the opposition isn’t willing to work 
in House leaders’ meetings.</span></p>

<p><span id="para864">I have to say—I’m going to give everyone the 
benefit of the doubt, including him—that I’m sure he has his view on how
 things should go, but then so do other people. Where you have to come 
together—I think sometimes that is where the friction is, how to come 
together in different ways, and it’s not just always you want what you 
want when you want it.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para865">1400</span></p>

<p><span id="para866">The motion that was brought forward—I understand 
that the government wants to move the business of this Legislature, but 
we are in a pandemic. There is so much going on outside of these four 
walls, and we have to address those things. Yes, there were agreements 
made, and if there are perceptions that those agreements are changed, 
why not come and speak and discuss it, as opposed to bringing the motion
 and making things so outside of the agreements that people are 
concerned as to where we’re going during a pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span id="para867">One of the bills, I have to say, is Bill 175, and 
it’s the bill that’s connecting people to home and community care. 
Again, in the context of a pandemic, putting this bill into this motion 
to push it faster through the Legislature isn’t a good idea. This is the
 time that you can take this opportunity to actually look at the home 
care bill, the Connecting People to Home and Community Care Act, around 
the pandemic. They have the power to make those changes.</span></p>

<p><span id="para868">I’m sure everyone has talked to home care workers,
 long-term-care workers, essential workers. We’ve all had these 
experiences; they’re not unique to any one of us. I spoke to home care 
workers and they said, “What we do is that we get one mask a day,” and 
they have to pick them up at the mask depot. That’s what they told me. 
They’re surgical masks. They get six masks a week if they work six days,
 and they get them in a brown paper bag. They have to wear one mask all 
day, and they see—this is what they said—10 different people during the 
day. And so when we’re talking about that particular description, and 
then we’re pushing through Bill 175, which is the Connecting People to 
Home and Community Care Act, again, we have to stop and think about 
what’s going on during the pandemic, during the coronavirus, and how 
it’s going to implicate what legislation we’re passing now.</span></p>

<p><span id="para869">Some of these pieces can, of course, be brought 
back. Again, we just had discussions about how the bills would be 
COVID-19-related, health-related, that kind of thing—emergency 
management orders. This is a bill that has a distinction that we can 
make, so why not bring that bill in? Why not discuss it or debate it and
 make sure that there are things that we can foresee in the future about
 prevention when it comes to viruses and workers in the workplace.</span></p>

<p><span id="para870">The other thing I can tell you that the home care 
workers talked about is that they’re expected to take the mask and use 
it—like I said, one a day, right? And then they have to go into the 
office for gloves and hand sanitizers. They’re not brought to them, so 
they’ve got to go to the depot for the surgical masks, and then they’ve 
got to go to the head office of this care provider to get their gloves 
and their hand sanitizers—and they get as many as they want, so they 
said that was a good thing, so there are some positives there. But what 
they want to know is, “Why can’t we have a mask for each visit?”, 
because that was a better process for them. They felt that, number one, 
you don’t want to be spreading the virus from resident to resident when 
you’re in a home care situation, and you’re also very much going home 
after visiting people in home care, bringing it home to your family.</span></p>

<p><span id="para871">We have often talked about home care, and it’s 
another whole, big health care discussion that needs to be fixed, along 
with long-term care. I know that I’ve been on the long-term-care file 
for many years, and I’ve brought these issues many times, numerous 
times. I brought forward the public inquiry, in the election of 2018 at 
that point, when we had Wettlaufer, to expand it, and that was shot 
down. I don’t know why governments of the day don’t want to actually 
acknowledge what the real problems are and then just fix them. We’re all
 talking about how we shouldn’t be blaming any government. Well, then, 
you know what? Do the right thing, get the real problems on the table 
and then repair it, because then it doesn’t keep trickling down to the 
next government, where someone tinkers on a commission or tinkers on a 
committee. It doesn’t really get to the root of the problem, and then it
 passes on to the next government that’s in power and then everybody is 
to blame. Well, we can stop that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para872">When the Premier said “hell or high water”—I think
 that was what it was. I can’t remember. Am I allowed to say that? I’ll 
change that: Heck or high water. Excuse me. I apologize. I was just 
quoting and not thinking of that. When he said that, the public inquiry,
 the independent, transparent public inquiry, where you can find the 
problem and fix the problem intermittently—it doesn’t mean you have to 
stop fixing the problems; that can be done, and that is something that 
we’ve been pushing for.</span></p>

<p><span id="para873">Now, I’m going back to the private members’ bill 
piece, how we are asking for Thursdays to be included in this whole 
debate. As the government House leader said, it doesn’t negate the 
ability of this Legislature to pass a private member’s bill. No, it does
 not, but the ones that are introduced are already there, and so, 
therefore, when you present a private member’s bill, you can only do it 
as an introduction. You can introduce a bill and that’s it. If we have 
Thursdays, we can actually debate it for the time that we are allowed as
 members to bring issues forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para874">I have a bill, Bill 13, on the books, which is the
 Time to Care Act. The government is looking for solutions around 
long-term care and how to solve these problems. Well, the Time to Care 
Act gives you a solution to that. It’s not just myself and the member 
from Nickel Belt who have advocated for this; it’s also other 
stakeholders that have advocated for this. So if he is looking to 
balance out passing government bills to private members’ bills, I urge 
the government to pass my bill, Bill 13, the Time to Care bill, in that 
vein. We’ll see if that happens—but giving people enough advance notice 
in order to properly represent their constituents, I think, should be 
the professional standard in this Legislature.</span></p>

<p><span id="para875">We’re all elected by our constituents in each one 
of our ridings. We all want to do the best job that we can. We all want 
to bring their voices and their problems to the Legislature, in a way 
that’s not sarcastic, in goodwill. I think we all do that. When we ask 
questions or when we bring stories forward in our debates, we’re all 
doing that. But if we’re not given the opportunity to, again, discuss 
these things, then it takes away that privilege that we do have. We’re 
all here on borrowed time. We don’t know what the next two years are 
going to bring, so we all want to do the best job possible. We all want 
to bring those strong legislative pieces that our constituents have 
endured.</span></p>

<p><span id="para876">Some of the legislation is feel-good legislation. 
They do good things. They’re promoting wonderful, positive things, like 
when we talk about certain heritage days or awareness days. And then 
there is other legislation with very, very heartfelt, horrible stories 
that push us to bring legislation forward in order to make real change. 
It could just affect one family that you have, but then all of a sudden 
you talk about this issue and you see that it’s widespread. And it’s not
 anyone in particular that owns that issue, because once you start 
bringing up a private member’s bill, as if we had the Thursdays, like we
 present in this motion, then what would happen is, you would actually 
get this back and forth and you’d hear it from other members on the 
government side, the independents, the opposition side. You would hear 
the commonalities of what is happening in other ridings that they can 
actually identify with and hopefully support, get to committee and pass 
one day.</span></p>

<p><span id="para877">But I have to say that the other three bills the 
government wants to quickly push through—I did look at the scheduling; 
maybe they know this, or maybe they don’t. They’ve got Bill 156, which, 
again, is a very important bill. It’s the biodiversity bill. In the 
context, again, of what we’re living through, the pandemic, there are 
many people who work in processing plants, right? You know that there 
are farmers worrying about the supply and demand and how that’s going to
 work. That is on June 8. Hearings are 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and then 1 
p.m. to 6 p.m., and then so is building transit, Bill 171. That’s also 
10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on June 8, and then on June 9, 
they’ve got it again at the same times. Then there is an extra day under
 Bill 171, the transit bill, where—again, I’m not presuming this could 
be a conflict for anyone, but it’s a possibility.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para878">1410</span></p>

<p><span id="para879">And that’s where you have to—when you say, “This 
is what I’m offering you,” and then someone points out, “Well, perhaps 
this is something that can be changed because it could be a challenge.” 
You can have farmers who are interested in transit. You can have people 
who are in transit interested in the farming. You are going to end up 
having people decide, “Where do I want to go? Can I present on two? Am I
 able to with the scheduling?”</span></p>

<p><span id="para880">Again, when we are in a coronavirus piece, yes, 
we’re all home, but there are parents who are home with their children 
and working, trying to juggle that. There are people home who took their
 families, their loved ones, out of long-term care to look after them. 
So they can’t just necessarily drop everything and plug in to those two 
days if they have an interest in either one, and that’s very plausible.</span></p>

<p><span id="para881">I have to say, as much as the government House 
leader or the government wants to paint that picture, I would ask that 
they remember that the intentions of everyone in this Legislature are to
 bring their best foot forward to represent their constituents and to 
try to work within what their beliefs are, what their best decisions 
they feel will be able to help move things forward. It may not always be
 what you say, and you may want to do whatever you want to do. But 
giving the courtesy, the respect, the professional back and forth so 
that we would have known on Tuesday we were going to come in and debate 
the defibrillator bill, would have been good. You’re a majority 
government. You can do what you like. You can bring it forward, and no 
one takes that away from you. But it is helpful to us if we’re given 
that instead of catching people off guard: “Hah, we got you. Because you
 did this, I’m doing that.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para882">I don’t see how that is helpful going forward. I 
don’t see how that is helpful, especially when we are supposed to be 
under this time, in a coronavirus situation, trying to work so that we 
can accomplish what we’re supposed to be doing for the people. They’re 
the ones that are depending on us to work together to come up with 
things that are going to prevent this from happening again. Nobody wants
 to see this occur again, and there are so many things that can be done,
 like I say, under Bill 175 that’s been put in the motion, that we could
 be doing differently.</span></p>

<p><span id="para883">I suggest one of the things we should be doing 
differently is looking at, again, the not-for-profit home care piece. 
Under previous governments, a lot of privatization was implemented in 
health care, and it’s not a good model. All dollars that go into public 
health care should be for care, should be patient-centred. I heard the 
minister say that today, that it should be patient-centred. How you get 
care patient-centred is you make sure that all the money you put into 
public health care is used for care. That’s patient-centred, right?</span></p>

<p><span id="para884">Having the government wanting to push this through
 the Legislature and, again, not even testing what a virtual committee 
composition would look like—that leaves a lot of questions: Are there 
going to be hiccups where people aren’t going to be able to get on? Is 
there going to be a problem because people can’t get on to present? Not 
everybody has the Internet throughout the whole province. Not everybody 
can get access to it. Is that going to be a concern? There are a lot of 
unanswered questions when you do that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para885">I only ask this government that they do consider 
that amendment, and even look at the difference in days that we 
suggested, to give people the opportunity to bring legislation and have 
it debated. As much as they want to debate their government bills, and 
they have a right to do that—so do members who are elected in their 
ridings to come to this Legislature and bring their ideas forward to 
make changes where they and their constituents live, and also have that 
debated.</span></p>

<p><span id="para886">With that being said, I will conclude my debate on this motion.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para887"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para888"><strong><span id="P909_228214">Mr. Mike Schreiner:</span></strong>
 I want to begin my remarks today by saying that I support having us sit
 this summer so that we can focus on combatting the virus and so we can 
focus on how we can safely reopen our economy and recover from this 
crisis.</span></p>

<p><span id="para889">I know that all members from every party in this 
House have been working incredibly long hours, meeting with our 
constituents, helping our constituents and listening to their concerns. 
We all want to come back here this summer and bring their concerns to 
this Legislature so we can act.</span></p>

<p><span id="para890">While I have some concerns with the original 
motion, the amendment that the member from London West brought forward 
addresses many of those concerns. But I’ll also suggest to my opposition
 colleagues that I believe that we could have addressed a lot of these 
concerns if we would all just engage together in good-faith 
negotiations. When I say that, I say that to every member of this House,
 myself included. We can all do better to rise to this occasion.</span></p>

<p><span id="para891">I have been so proud of the way this House has 
conducted itself over the last two months. People have set aside 
partisanship. I call it “quarantining partisanship.” We have done that. 
We haven’t all agreed. We’ve met four times in extraordinary sittings to
 pass bills and even a mini-budget through unanimous consent. It’s 
extraordinary that we’ve been able to do that, but it makes sense given 
the extraordinary crisis that we’re facing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para892">Now this week, I sadly see that unity slipping 
away. It disappoints me, Speaker, because I think that in this time of 
crisis, the people of Ontario expect us to work together. They expect us
 to be stronger together. That hashtag has meaning. It’s not just a 
hashtag; it actually has meaning. I believe it’s our responsibility to 
live up to the expectations on which we were elected to live up to—not 
to play petty political games with each other, but to actually do the 
people’s work, not just in words but in actions.</span></p>

<p><span id="para893">We have made a difference. We have shown people we
 can do that. But what does it say to people that while our public 
health leaders are scolding people for what happened at Trinity 
Bellwoods Park on Saturday, we saw what happened in this House this 
morning? Because we couldn’t all agree on a unanimous consent motion, 
the people crammed in this House. We violated public health guidelines 
this morning, because we couldn’t agree on a unanimous consent motion.</span></p>

<p><span id="para894">Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to play a blame game. I 
don’t want to point fingers, because we’re all responsible for that, and
 I include myself in that. I’ve ratcheted up the partisanship over the 
last few days; I think we all have. In some ways, it’s probably 
inevitable. It is politics, after all. We were all elected here with a 
different vision, with a different agenda, with different policies that 
we wanted to support and fight for. The people who voted for us expect 
us to fight for those policies with passion and commitment. I believe we
 can do it and still figure out ways to work together.</span></p>

<p><span id="para895">So when we debate bills over the next few weeks, 
instead of trying to navigate the private property rights of farmers 
with the constitutional rights of activists, why don’t we talk about how
 our food system can be resilient in the face of the COVID-19 crisis? 
Instead of talking about new ways of building transit, can we talk about
 how we can make sure our transit systems actually survive this crisis? 
And instead of playing political games, can we get this finance 
committee working, with all members talking about ways in which we can 
bring forward legislation to debate in this House that helps us with the
 economic recovery?</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para896">1420</span></p>

<p><span id="para897">My gosh, people, think of the front-line workers 
putting their lives on the line to keep us safe and healthy. Think of 
the small business owners who are barely hanging on. Think of the people
 in long-term care. The tragedy continues, and we have to solve it. 
Think of the millions of Ontarians out of work. And then ask yourselves 
what they are asking of us, that we could maybe at least come up with a 
summer schedule together that works—and yes, I believe we should have 
PMBs, but maybe we can figure out a way to do that without this 
acrimonious debate.</span></p>

<p><span id="para898">So I’m asking members of the government, the 
government House leader specifically—who, I will remind everyone, has 
given the opposition more time to participate in debates and to hold the
 government accountable—I’m asking the official opposition and I’m 
asking the independents; I’m asking us all to come together and reach a 
compromise for the summer sitting, because the people of Ontario expect 
that of us.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para899"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para900"><strong><span id="P921_233325">Mr. Rick Nicholls:</span></strong>
 It’s an honour and a privilege to be able to rise in this Legislature. 
I’m now in my ninth year sitting in this Legislature, and it’s been a 
true honour and privilege to represent the people of, previously, 
Chatham-Kent–Essex, now Chatham-Kent–Leamington.</span></p>

<p><span id="para901">Speaker, a couple of things I want to point out: 
Back in 2018—you know what? That’s almost two years ago—when we were all
 in this Legislature, pounding a beat and wondering on that identified 
day, will we be elected or, in some cases, re-elected to represent the 
people of our ridings. I was successful and everyone in this Legislature
 was successful, back in June 2018.</span></p>

<p><span id="para902">We formed government. We formed government with a 
purpose. We had a mandate. We ran on a mandate. All the other parties 
had their mandates as well. Perhaps some of the mandates overlapped, and
 of course, because of our various backgrounds and political 
affiliations, some of those mandates did not overlap. It made them very 
distinct and very clear.</span></p>

<p><span id="para903">Earlier this morning, I listened intently to the 
member from Barrie–Innisfil as she read—and it was lengthy—the motion 
that we initially started to debate this morning and earlier this 
afternoon, for which then the official opposition brought forward an 
amendment, of which we are addressing the amendment to the motion. I 
looked at it and I thought to myself, the initial motion had us sitting 
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in June and on Mondays, Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays in July—I think three weeks totalling nine days in July 
and—you can do the math—I think it was six days, maybe, in June.</span></p>

<p><span id="para904">Interjection.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para905"><strong>Mr. Rick Nicholls:</strong> How many? Four days. I guess I’m thinking the first week of June and then the other sittings.</span></p>

<p><span id="para906">Regardless of that, now the amendment wants to add
 Thursdays to that particular motion, from what I’m hearing—and there’s a
 whole bunch of other things they want to drop off in terms of committee
 hearings. I have concerns about that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para907">I’m going to go back to 2018, when we formed 
government, based on a mandate. We still have that mandate, and we’re 
working hard for the people in Ontario. Yes, that means the people in 
our ridings, but it also means the people in your ridings in the 
opposition as well—because we’re not just for Progressive Conservatives.
 We’re for all Ontarians, which include your members, of the NDP, of the
 Liberals, of the Green Party, and independents as well.</span></p>

<p><span id="para908">So when I think about that and I try to look 
further, I think to myself, “Well, because of our mandate, we need to 
get things done.” Now, the member for Guelph spoke about working 
together. I couldn’t agree with him more. How do we do that? I, for one,
 am an individual that likes to lay partisanship aside, because we 
should all have the attitude in this Legislature that we work for the 
better whole. We work for everyone. We will differ on our approach. We 
may differ with our ideas, concepts. That’s the democratic process. I 
think it’s important for us all to realize, though, that we still need 
to get work done.</span></p>

<p><span id="para909">Nobody knew. Nobody planned. Nobody had any idea 
of what COVID-19 was. I’ve said to people back in my riding, “We are 
involved in world war III. The only difference from other world wars is 
in this world war, we cannot see our enemy. It’s that virus.” So as a 
government, we didn’t have a playbook to fall back on. We had to create a
 playbook. It wasn’t just us, though. It was listening to other ideas 
that may have come forward from other members in this Legislature, be it
 from the official opposition, the Green Party, from the independents, 
the Liberals, because we work together on this.</span></p>

<p><span id="para910">I say all of that because this COVID-19 has set 
the world back on its heels. We’ve got to work hard, and we continue to 
work for the people, we continue to look forward and—as I say to 
people—look up. Why do I do that? Because it’s funny, when we are in 
stressful situations, anxiety, and we all know—and maybe some of us in 
this Legislature have experienced fear. I say to people, “Do not live in
 fear, because if you live in fear, you can be controlled.” Rather, as a
 government, we have put forth guidelines to help people, to take away 
that anxiety, some of that fear. The guidelines themselves are put in 
place to keep people safe. Premier Ford has talked about and emphasizes,
 day in and day out, the importance of maintaining the health and safety
 of all Ontarians. Some people might say, “He’s not moving fast enough,”
 and other people would say, “Boy, slow down. You move too fast.”</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para911"><strong>Mr. Percy Hatfield:</strong> Got to make the morning last.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para912"><strong>Mr. Rick Nicholls:</strong>
 There was a song in there. I know, I know; those of you who know me, 
everything is a song. Everything is a song. Thank you to the member 
from—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para913"><strong>Mrs. Robin Martin:</strong> It’s a good vintage.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para914"><strong>Mr. Rick Nicholls:</strong> Golly—from Windsor–Tecumseh, yes. He and I, we have a lot of fun with that. It’s because we’re vintage—same vintage and so on.</span></p>

<p><span id="para915">Again, I look at this. This COVID-19 was 
unplanned. We as a government still need to proceed with getting 
business done. We can’t let COVID-19 keep us back on our heels. Oh, has 
it knocked us back a bit? You bet it has.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para916">1430</span></p>

<p><span id="para917">For the opposition, your mandate is to hold the 
government accountable. I get that. Because from your vantage point, 
when you look across the aisle, you see an eagle—watching the government
 with an eagle eye. I said “eagle,” not “evil”; there is a difference.</span></p>

<p><span id="para918">But we on this side, when we look across at the 
opposition and we look upwards, we see an owl, which means we have to 
create legislation—hopefully with everyone’s help, but there will be 
differences and we get that—but we have to exercise wisdom in our 
decision-making.</span></p>

<p><span id="para919">Unfortunately, one size does not fit all. I would 
caution people during COVID-19—I have told people: Do not wear stretchy 
pants, a one-size-fits-all, because when you get back into regular 
clothes, you are going to realize, oops, I might be carrying a COVID-19 
quarter pounder or two—or maybe three. Listen, in times like this, if 
you do not have a sense of humour, what do you have? What do you have? 
Humour will also help to get those endorphins flowing, and that’s 
healthy.</span></p>

<p><span id="para920">So golly, when I look at things and I talk about the current situation, we’re all here. We want to get business done.</span></p>

<p><span id="para921">I want to go back to the Thursday sittings that 
the amendment is really addressing as well, because I don’t believe I’ve
 mentioned it. When we have Thursday sittings, all of us in this 
Legislature know and realize, that’s also an opportunity for private 
members’ business, PMBs, as we call them. The member from London West 
spoke earlier about the member from Niagara Falls who has a PMB. I 
looked at the schedule, and he is not scheduled until November.</span></p>

<p><span id="para922">There has also been a total of nine other PMBs 
that have been waived right now—mine was one of them—because of the 
cancellation and the House not sitting. I’m okay with that, because 
here’s the other thing: There are other members in this Legislature, 
those who maybe had their PMBs waived for now—because when we come back,
 that opportunity will exist. But in addition to that, there isn’t the 
legislative counsel here to help us create proper legislation for 
private members’ bills. That’s very problematic, and we have to kind of 
still go in order.</span></p>

<p><span id="para923">So that’s one of the reasons why I support what my
 government House leader says, and what we say as a government—that we 
can’t sit on Thursdays. We can get done in three days what you might 
think would take four days.</span></p>

<p><span id="para924">We have important legislation that still needs to 
be brought forward. Four of those legislations include Bill 156, which 
is the Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020. It’s
 going to be studied in the Standing Committee on General Government. In
 my riding, that bill is extremely critical. I’m not downplaying that 
it’s not critical in your ridings either.</span></p>

<p><span id="para925">I want to share something with you. My area is 
fairly rural. We have a lot of dairy cattle, we have a lot of beef 
cattle, and of course chickens, hogs, all of that—a lot of pig farmers. 
But I remember that I have actually visited on several occasions a mink 
farm. Now, I don’t know if anybody here has ever had a chance to visit a
 mink farm before or not, but it’s fascinating. It’s absolutely 
fascinating. You see these cute little critters—by the way, don’t put 
your finger in to pet them. They have sharp teeth. But what happens? You
 get these animal advocates. These are mink farmers who are providing 
for their family, they are generating revenue and they are helping the 
economy. And then you get these animal advocates who will poach or 
they’ll come in late at night and open up all the cages and allow these 
helpless minks to escape—and to where? They become roadkill or they 
become a meal for coyotes—we have a lot of coyotes in our area. That’s 
no way either. So, again, this bill needs to get passed. Not just for 
that reason, but also for the fact that it’s part of the food chain. We 
need to ensure that we have food.</span></p>

<p><span id="para926">You hear a lot about individuals who are—and 
you’ve seen signs, I’m sure, in your ridings, where people have said, “A
 hero lives here.” Well, God bless them. Those are people who have put 
their lives on the line, especially in the early goings of COVID-19, to 
care for those people who are sick, taking the necessary precautions 
through personal protective equipment to care for these people. Have 
some died? Yes. It’s tragic.</span></p>

<p><span id="para927">The initial modelling numbers were huge, but I 
think we’ve all come to realize that those modelling numbers were also 
way out—fortunately, way off. There are a lot of reasons that we could 
attribute that to, part of which, I think, we have to owe to the 14 
million people in the province of Ontario, 95% of whom said, “You know 
what? I’m going to take the necessary precautions. I don’t know if it’s 
going to affect me or not, and therefore I will follow the guidelines 
that the government has laid down for us to keep us all safe.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para928">Now, maybe, initially, for a couple of weeks, 
people thought, “This is kind of cool. I’m home. I can spend time with 
my family.” But we also know the drawbacks of being home way too long, 
because a lot of people are running out of money. The provincial 
government, in conjunction with the federal government, is working to 
provide funds for people who have been laid off or are unemployed. What 
about those who aren’t eligible for EI—employment insurance—the sole 
proprietor, so to speak? You think about that. What do they do? Well, 
there is that CERB program that the federals are offering. Now, I 
believe that’s only for four months, but let’s hope that, by the time 
that ends, we’ll be back on track and we won’t be on our heels; we’ll be
 leaning forward on the balls of our feet, ready to run forward, to pick
 up the baton from where we left off and to keep moving. We’ve got to 
have hope. We’ve got to be able to project hope for people, not 
doomsday.</span></p>

<p><span id="para929">I think it’s really, really imperative not just 
the government but for all sides: Don’t project a picture of doom; 
project a picture of hope. Because that’s what people hold on to, 
especially in times like this. It’s vital, it’s critical, it’s 
imperative that that’s what happens.</span></p>

<p><span id="para930">Again, part of the amendment that the member from 
London West brought forward is, to my understanding, to eliminate all 
the committee hearings. We need those committee hearings. We do. The 
reason why we need them is because we have important legislation, and 
you’ll agree that it is important legislation. You may not agree with 
everything in all those bills—fair enough—but it’s important legislation
 that we get passed so that we can move forward, we can get the economy 
going, and we can get people back to work, we can get people healthy and
 we can ensure that we have the food chain in place to take care of 
people as well.</span></p>

<p><span id="para931">There are many other aspects of the other bills 
that we talked about as well. I only talked about Bill 156, but the 
Smarter and Stronger Justice Act is important. I think everyone in this 
place would agree that the justice system is broken. There has got to be
 a way to expedite hearings and get things moving in the right 
direction, rather than let it drag on, drag on, drag on.</span></p>

<p><span id="para932">We talk about building transit faster. I can’t wait for Chatham, Ontario, to have its first subway.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para933">1440</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para934"><strong>Mrs. Robin Martin:</strong> You’ll be waiting a lot.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para935"><strong>Mr. Rick Nicholls:</strong> Okay, I might be waiting a while. I might be waiting a while.</span></p>

<p><span id="para936">But the point is, we’ve got to get people moving. 
We’ve got to be able to find and figure out ways to help, whether it be 
GO trains or subways or Via Rail or—I don’t care what it is, but we’ve 
got to keep people moving and cut down, maybe, on the congestion. That 
bill is critical.</span></p>

<p><span id="para937">Then, of course, the Minister of Health, the 
Honourable Christine Elliott, spoke about Bill 175, Connecting People to
 Home and Community Care Act. When I had a listen to what she had to 
say, I would interpret it as, there are four main pillars. One was 
prevention and health promotion. We could talk ad nauseam—no pun 
intended—with regard to what that really means. Also, pillar 2 talks 
about the fact that we as a government, over 10 years, are going to be 
investing $27 billion in hospital infrastructure projects. Why? Because 
we need them. A lot of our hospitals right now are failing. The bricks 
are literally falling off the building. They’re overcrowded. We need new
 equipment, because we have very, very intelligent doctors in the 
science side of things. It’s critical that we provide the best form of 
hospital care, health care, for the people of Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para938">So I will be voting against this particular 
amendment put forward by the NDP. I appreciate what they were thinking 
about, but again, I stand strong with what we want for summer sittings.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para939"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Further debate? The member for Windsor–Tecumseh.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para940"><strong><span id="P961_248810">Mr. Percy Hatfield:</span></strong>
 Thank you, Speaker, and good afternoon to you. It is always an honour 
to stand in this House. My voice is somewhat squeaky today. I think it’s
 from the allergies I have. One of them is smoke, and I think a lot of 
people have been blowing smoke here in the last couple of days. I say 
that with a sense of humour, and I’ll try not to inhale much more of it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para941">I want to compliment the leader of the Green Party
 for reminding us that we are in the middle of a pandemic and we should 
all be working together in the interest of all of the people in Ontario.
 I am not a privileged member of the House leaders team or the leaders 
team, so I’m not privy to what goes on in phone calls and back rooms. I 
know, as a member, when I come here I judge my colleagues on what I see 
in the House. I am somewhat taken by surprise sometimes, as I was 
yesterday, because I thought that since we’re all in this together, 
working together, it was working okay. I thought the air went out the 
balloon yesterday when the government, with very little notice, plopped 
on our desks that we were going to be debating a housing bill, which is 
fine; you have the right to do that, and we have the right to comment on
 it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para942">I’ve only been in the House for seven years. I’ve 
been here in a minority situation and now two majorities as a member of 
the opposition. But any time in my seven years, on all sides of the 
House, I have heard people ask for unanimous consent to stand down the 
lead of a debate because the critic for the party asking for the UC 
wasn’t here or would be here eventually—we heard today that we wanted to
 stand down our first few questions because a certain member of the 
cabinet wasn’t here and we wanted to be able to ask that person 
questions. At other times with this government we’ve asked that and that
 was granted. That person was running late, and so we did some other 
questions until that person got here, and then our leader asked her 
questions to the member we were waiting for.</span></p>

<p><span id="para943">But yesterday, when our critic Suze Morrison, the 
great member for Toronto Centre, our housing critic, wasn’t in the 
House—she knows more about housing, I would put forth, than any other 
member in this House. She does a great job for us. By any principle of 
decency, any principle of House tradition, when we ask to seek unanimous
 consent to stand down the lead, the answer, in my seven years, has 
always been, “Yes, of course,” because it’s a give-and-take. It’s how we
 do things. We work together. We work things out, because tomorrow it 
may be that another member on the other side wants to stand something 
down because they’re not quite prepared or they’re not available at the 
moment or whatever, and so it’s give-and-take. We say, “Of course, yes.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para944">Earlier, before a lot of rule changes, the 
independent Liberals would stand up and ask for unanimous consent for a 
member from one riding to speak, because the other independent Liberal 
who was supposed to speak wasn’t here that day but it was that person’s 
turn to ask a question. Well, sometimes it was yes, sometimes it was no,
 but more often than not it was yes, because the person had a legitimate
 excuse for not being here. If that person didn’t call in and say, “I’m 
stuck on a plane in North Bay. I can’t get here. The plane is fogged 
in”—then you’d say, “Okay, yes, I’ll let somebody else ask your 
question.” Not if it’s, “I don’t feel like coming in to work today, so I
 didn’t call in to say I won’t be here”—so no, you’re not getting 
unanimous consent.</span></p>

<p><span id="para945">But when we asked yesterday for unanimous consent 
to stand down the lead, we were told no, so I’m thinking it’s kind of a 
tit-for-tat. If the government House leader asked for unanimous consent 
to bring in all of his members from around the province today to stand 
or sit in the public galleries and be counted on a vote, and we said no,
 that was in response to being told no yesterday. That’s just my 
guessing; I’m not part of the team that makes these decisions. I had no 
idea that had even taken place, until all of a sudden the government 
benches flooded with practically every member, which was interesting.</span></p>

<p><span id="para946">It reminds me of what the Premier had to say last 
weekend after the good folks flooded Trinity Bellwoods Park and didn’t 
keep a social distance. The Premier was very upset with them, all the 
people in Trinity Bellwoods and that neighbourhood. There were thousands
 of them really close together.</span></p>

<p><span id="para947">In the House, where we’re supposed to set an 
example for all of the people of Ontario—if you look at Ottawa, 
sometimes they’re so far apart, sometimes they do it on TV in their 
Parliament, but no other Parliament that I’m aware of in Canada 
currently brings all the members in, cheek to jowl, and takes part in 
voting. If we say one thing, “This is how we expect you to act,” and 
then we go the other way and we don’t act that way ourselves—I suppose 
it’s something like, “Don’t go to cottage country,” and I go to cottage 
country, or “Don’t have the kids over for Easter dinner,” and I have the
 kids over for Easter dinner.</span></p>

<p><span id="para948">I saw the photographer, and I think he’s with the 
Toronto Star, taking pictures today, so I imagine that on the front page
 of the Toronto Star tomorrow, if it isn’t online already, we’re going 
to see, “Politicians Say One Thing, Do Another.” That is going to hurt 
our reputations as politicians, because people are already saying that 
certain members of the government say one thing and do another, and now 
we’re going to be all lumped into this together because we didn’t keep a
 social distance.</span></p>

<p><span id="para949">I believe we all wore a mask except our table 
officers. Our table officers may have been exposed to COVID-19 today. 
Who knows? I’m certainly not a fearmonger; I’m not trying to suggest 
that. I know, Speaker, you put your mask on halfway through, and good 
for you, but we were, on this side of the House, somewhat surprised. Not
 all of us—I left my mask upstairs, I think, yes, but there were others 
who had extras, so I could have had one. But I had one today, the one I 
wear on the train where, on the Via Rail from Windsor to Toronto, we 
keep a social distance. They might only have eight or 10 people in the 
car and you’re always at least six feet away from the nearest other 
passenger. So we live a social distance protocol philosophy, and yet 
when we come in the House today, boom, blow it up. Was it petty 
politics? Was it political games? It’s not up to me to write that 
editorial. But I would imagine we will be criticized for what happened 
here today.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para950">1450</span></p>

<p><span id="para951">I support my deputy House leader’s amendment to 
add a sitting day on Thursday over the summer sessions. I don’t care if 
we go June, July, August and September. I’m prepared to come in on 
Thursdays as well as the other days of the week and do what I’m paid to 
do. As has been said, we can do more private members’ bills on 
Thursdays.</span></p>

<p><span id="para952">My friend the government House leader said, “Well,
 we just did one for the member from Eglinton–Lawrence yesterday.” I 
applaud the member from Eglinton–Lawrence. That was a great private 
member’s bill. She knows that members on our side have been proposing 
identical legislation for several years, so I applaud her for being able
 to push that forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para953">I was the beneficiary of a private member’s bill 
just the last day we sat in December, bringing in a poet laureate in 
Ontario. The Clerk of the Legislature told me yesterday that we’re 
advancing on that. The Ontario Arts Council has just named two 
representatives—which is called for in the bill—to the nomination 
committee, and I hope the Speaker soon puts out a call for nominations 
for the poet laureate of Ontario and we can name that person in the 
fall.</span></p>

<p><span id="para954">So private members’ bills—I believe in them 
strongly. I’ve had four accepted. Two I’ve jointly shared with other 
members. It’s quite an accomplishment, so I again congratulate the 
member from Eglinton–Lawrence. Adding a sitting day on Thursday, I 
believe, is something all members and all parties stand to benefit from.
 A lot of these bills—as mentioned, the member from Niagara Falls has 
one that would be up, on a COVID-19-related workplace situation. The 
member for Chatham-Kent–Leamington said that it wasn’t going to be up 
until November. But Speaker, as you know, we have the ability within the
 House to switch ballot dates and move things along a lot quicker.</span></p>

<p><span id="para955">I know I had a ballot date that was going to be up
 in June, and I was going to prepare a resolution helping our Legions be
 able to raise funds through their daily draws, their weekly draws, 
loonie-toonie draws, which the AGCO, the OLG, took away because it 
wasn’t designated in the act. Our Legions are hurting, as you know, but 
this would allow them, again, to raise some money and to entice people 
to the branch, give them a reason to go to the branch and sign the book,
 throw a quarter in the pot or a loonie or a toonie and keep the branch 
going, keep those funds coming in. While you’re there, you might have a 
pop or a drink or just socialize. It helps to keep our veterans active 
and social.</span></p>

<p><span id="para956">Now with COVID-19, of course, we’ve heard our 
member from St. Catharines say again this week that insurance rates are 
killing our Legions because they’re getting no break in their insurance.
 There’s no revenue coming in. They’ve asked for help, first from their 
insurance companies, which said, “No. To heck with you. You’re only 
veterans, after all.” So now they’re asking for help from the 
government, provincial and federal, to keep our Legions active and 
financially sound. I hope that at some point over the course of these 
next few weeks, we do take some measures to help our veterans.</span></p>

<p><span id="para957">Canadian military veterans have served us well and
 the unfortunate case—Speaker, I do read newspapers. I don’t like to 
read online; I like to have the page and turn it. Mr. Coyle, Jim Coyle 
in the Toronto Star has, the last few Sundays, anyway, written bios, 
biographies, obituaries of the people who have passed away to say, 
“These are the people that you see as a statistic, as a number, but Joe 
was a veteran and Joe survived the war. He raised a family, he was a 
coach and he was active in his church.” It gives you a more complete 
picture of the people who have passed away.</span></p>

<p><span id="para958">Well, several of the bios that he’s done have been
 veterans. It breaks my heart. My dad was a veteran. My mom is in a home
 at 96. But to think of our veterans, after everything they did for us, 
now in a home, living in circumstances—you wouldn’t keep a family pet in
 such circumstances. As the Canadian military report released yesterday 
just enunciated, the conditions are terrible—and it’s for everyone, not 
just the veterans in the long-term-care homes; it’s for everyone.</span></p>

<p><span id="para959">When we stand, on this side of the House, 
repeatedly calling for a fully independent public inquiry, and not a 
commission that may get started in September, we think it’s the right 
thing to do. I know the government members say, “Well, it wouldn’t 
happen quickly enough,” but what’s to say you couldn’t do both, or you 
couldn’t have several streams going, where somebody jumps in right away 
and somebody tells us, “We’ve only been in five homes with the military,
 but what about the other homes in Ontario, let alone across the 
country?”</span></p>

<p><span id="para960">With the homes in Ontario, we know there have been
 problems. Everyone in the House has met, I would think—on lobby days, 
when the PSWs, the nurses and the employees of the homes come to our 
offices and they put on a breakfast or a reception and they tell us 
about the conditions in long-term-care homes in Ontario. For years 
they’ve been telling us, “We don’t have enough people. Our people are 
underpaid. They’re overworked. When we call in sick, we’re not replaced.
 We don’t have enough time to get the number of people that we’re 
supposed to look after up out of bed in the morning and down to 
breakfast before the next group of residents comes in, let alone 
toileting throughout the day, let alone turning them for bedsores and 
getting out of the bed and into a chair to watch TV or to socialize or 
whatever.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para961">And the working conditions are such that we can’t 
get enough and retain enough personal support workers or registered 
nurses or social workers in these roles—horrendous stories of one nurse 
for an entire home of more than 200 or 300 residents, and the PSWs being
 told, “Wear this equipment longer because we’ve got a money crunch.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para962">I know I had calls early on from homes in my area,
 from PSWs saying, “Look, we’re told we can’t get the equipment.” The 
minister keeps saying, “We have the equipment. Everybody has it. Don’t 
worry about it. We’re all looked after,” and I would get the calls and 
the emails that night: “It’s not true. We’re not getting the equipment 
we need. We don’t have the gloves. We don’t have the masks.” Fortunately
 Ford Motor Co., Wiser’s and other people stepped up and starting making
 hand sanitizer, masks and gloves and donated them down my way. So we 
are doing what we can in my area to look after ourselves, but we are 
still in great need.</span></p>

<p><span id="para963">Speaker, I just want to say as we rush towards 
these bills over the summer—I know you’ve been on committees before—I 
had an email just at lunch today from a woman from the humane society 
talking about the PAWS bill that we all approved not that long ago. They
 were told—they’re leaving a lot of stuff in regulations—not to worry 
about it. She said:</span></p>

<p><span id="para964">“As we discussed when the PAWS Act was passed, it 
includes a lot of great provisions and a lot of potential improvements 
to animal welfare. But our concern was that while the structure was 
there, its success would depend on both the quality of the enforcement, 
as well as on the government putting strong regulations in place.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para965">1500</span></p>

<p><span id="para966">“I’m writing today with concerns about a number of
 regulations that need to be put into place but haven’t. I realize that 
the government is dealing with a lot at the moment, but they have had 
months to work on this. One in particular relates to section 6 of the 
ministerial prescriptions, which defines a ‘shelter,’ and when a shelter
 is deemed to be an abandoned animal’s owner. When the transitional 
regulation was passed in December it used the wording from the old 
legislation, which limits shelters to affiliates of the Ontario SPCA. 
Many large Ontario shelters (including ours)”—the one in Windsor—“have 
withdrawn as affiliates of the Ontario SPCA due to concerns about the 
governance of that organization, and therefore are not afforded 
protection under this section. I brought these concerns to the office of
 the” Solicitor General’s “attention in December and was advised that 
‘this is one of the transition regulations we intend to look at early’ 
but to date no progress has been made.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para967">The next thing she talks about: “The second 
regulation not yet put into place” has “become more urgent as the 
weather warms. Section 34(1) of the PAWS Act says that ‘A prescribed 
person who has reasonable grounds to believe that there is an animal in 
critical distress in a motor vehicle may enter the motor vehicle for the
 purpose of relieving the animal from distress.’ But to date to our 
understanding, no persons have been prescribed by regulation and 
therefore the only people in the province who can legally rescue an 
animal from a vehicle are a provincial inspector or a police officer. I 
fear that if this regulation isn’t passed identifying additional people 
(like municipal bylaw enforcement officers) who can enter a vehicle to 
rescue an animal in distress, there will be cases this summer where dogs
 die in a vehicle before a police officer is able to arrive.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para968">Speaker, I just wanted to put that on the table, 
because I know, when these bills get to a committee and amendments are 
made, sometimes they’re dealt with, sometimes they’re accepted by 
government, sometimes not. I know, when the Liberals were there—I 
remember being on one committee; 75 amendments were made, and 45 of them
 came from the Liberals themselves because they had rushed to judgment 
too early and put a bill on the table that needed a lot of improvement.</span></p>

<p><span id="para969">So thank you for this this afternoon, and I do hope you support the amendment put forward by the member from London West.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para970"><strong>The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para971"><strong><span id="P992_266418">Ms. Donna Skelly:</span></strong>
 I want to say that it is truly a privilege, truly an honour, to be able
 to stand here in the House this afternoon to speak to this motion, 
motion 77. Those same words have been uttered by many people this 
afternoon. But think about the privilege of being an elected member of 
the Ontario Legislature. It was less than two years ago that all of us 
won our seats. Our journeys are all different, whatever paths brought us
 here are all different, but we all chose to put our names on a ballot 
to work with a party that we believed represented our values and the 
values of the people in our constituencies. We won our elections and 
we’re sitting here today in a government, during perhaps the worst 
crisis ever in this province’s history.</span></p>

<p><span id="para972">When I say it’s a privilege to be here, it is a 
privilege because we have the power to influence change, to bring about 
solutions to truly, genuinely help the people of Ontario. We have that 
power. But we can only do it if we come to work, if we sit in this 
House, if we debate legislation, if we propose legislation, if we work 
together or even if we work in opposition. We are part of a government 
that will move an agenda forward, and we are part of a historic 
government during a critical time in Ontario’s history, and each one of 
us wants to do what we can for our constituents and for all people in 
Ontario, all sectors, all regions. But we truly can only accomplish 
serious objectives if we come to work and we pass legislation—or we 
oppose legislation, based on how we feel about particular bills. That’s 
why I say I feel it is a privilege—truly, genuinely a privilege—to be in
 this House at this time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para973">I don’t know if any of you have ever, ever had the
 unfortunate experience of being out of work, but I was and it is awful.
 Many years ago, I worked for a company that went bankrupt suddenly. I 
was a single mother. It was just weeks before Christmas. We were 
literally told, in the course of hours, “You’re out of work. You will 
get no compensation and no severance pay. Here’s the door.” I know how 
it feels to be wondering how I’m going to feed my kids, how I’m going 
make my mortgage payment, how I’m going to get by, and unfortunately, I 
know many, many people in Ontario are feeling that right now.</span></p>

<p><span id="para974">This privilege also comes with tremendous 
responsibility. We can stand here and debate and flex our muscles and 
talk about egos, but at the end of the day, we have a responsibility to 
make the lives of all Ontarians better, and that responsibility has 
never been so great as it is during this global pandemic. We talked 
about the front-line workers, who truly are heroes, and sometimes I’m 
embarrassed that they have to take on that responsibility and go out and
 deal with people who are dying from COVID-19 while I sit behind a 
computer in the safety of my home, drinking a coffee. I am not 
embarrassed today to say I want to be here, in this House, because I 
know we have such a tremendous opportunity over the next few weeks to 
make that difference.</span></p>

<p><span id="para975">Earlier, the member from London West said that she
 hadn’t heard from people raising issues about the bills that, if we 
move forward with motion 77, will be addressed over the course of the 
next few months. I have to argue that I have heard from people. My 
riding is a mix of rural and urban. Flamborough–Glanbrook also—most 
people don’t realize, because it’s part of Hamilton—contributes over $1 
billion in its agri-food sector to our local economy each and every 
year. So I do hear from people in the agri-food sector who are quite, 
quite concerned about how they can protect their products, their 
animals, their farms. While it may not sound, especially if you’re from 
urban areas, that this is an important thing to be discussing now, it 
is, because the reality is, COVID-19 is here today. We must deal with 
all of the additional challenges that this crisis has raised, but we 
also have to move this economy forward. We also have to move forward. We
 will come out of it. I know we will. But at the end of it, we have to 
have measures in place to ensure that Ontarians can recover, that the 
different sectors across this province can recover.</span></p>

<p><span id="para976">These are just some of the ways that we can do 
that. Transportation: Again, I’m from Hamilton, so I commute almost on a
 regular basis, almost daily, to the city of Toronto. Other than during 
COVID-19, it’s not an easy task. I can leave here after 6 or 6:30 in the
 evening, and just to get to the Gardiner there’s a minimum of 30 
minutes. Once you get to the Gardiner, to get onto the Gardiner—this is 
true—it’s an additional 30 minutes. Just to get onto the Gardiner, 
coming from Queen’s Park, is one hour. Then you have to get to 
Burlington. Burlington is another choking point. It’s unbelievable the 
amount of cars on the roads in the GTHA. From Burlington to where I live
 in the city of Hamilton is another hour. My trip can be three hours 
home during rush hour. That is not sustainable. People cannot endure 
that indefinitely.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para977">1510</span></p>

<p><span id="para978">The biggest problem that the city of Toronto 
faces, beyond COVID-19, is the movement of people and goods. We can’t 
forget that while we’re dealing with these overwhelming challenges that 
are associated with COVID-19, because we have to deal with it. We do 
have to move people. We do have to move goods.</span></p>

<p><span id="para979">Just coming back into work this morning, I was 
surprised at the number of cars now on the roads. Yes, it’s shorter, 
much shorter, but I was absolutely gobsmacked at the number of transport
 trucks. People need food. People need PPE. People need clothing. They 
need supplies. They’re being moved to different locations through many 
means, but also through transit trucks. And they are choking our 
highways.</span></p>

<p><span id="para980">The measures that we’re putting in place, just in 
Bill 171, the Building Transit Faster Act, won’t help all of Ontario. It
 won’t help all of the GTHA, but it is a critical component of moving 
people and of moving goods through Toronto and the GTA. It may not be 
top of mind today when we’re thinking about some of the other tremendous
 challenges that we have all raised throughout the day, but it will be 
when we move towards recovery.</span></p>

<p><span id="para981">One of the comments, again made by the member from
 London West, was about the reluctance to move forward to support motion
 77 because, when she spoke to Bill 158, farmers would have to travel to
 Toronto. We know that’s not the case. We are suggesting, as we all have
 through the past two or three months, that we meet and hear from 
Ontarians right across Ontario through virtual meetings. That is a new 
reality. I know that every single person in this Legislature is using a 
computer far more often to engage with constituents and with 
stakeholders.</span></p>

<p><span id="para982">As the sole government-side representative in the 
city of Hamilton, I meet with sectors right across the city of Hamilton,
 with stakeholders right across the city of Hamilton, with constituents 
right across the city of Hamilton, including Flamborough–Glanbrook. I 
speak to the many—and there are 14 or 15—BIAs, and some of the things 
that they’ve raised I want to be able to share here in the House over 
the next few months. As I mentioned, some of these people are worried 
about paying the bills. Many, many, many are worried about paying the 
bills. They wonder if they will ever reopen. They wonder if their 
businesses that they have put their heart and soul in, for years or a 
lifetime, will survive.</span></p>

<p><span id="para983">I want to share the story of one woman who called 
me just over two weeks ago. It was just before we were reopening the 
garden centres. She was in tears. It was a business that she and her 
husband had spent a lifetime building, and it was coming up to Mother’s 
Day. It was a critical time of year to open. She was sharing with me the
 devastation that the family was already feeling because of the 
sensitive timelines with the product—of course, with gardening and 
flowers—that she had to sell, and the impact of a delay in opening her 
business to her family, to her children and to their livelihood. These 
are the types of stories that we are hearing from Ontarians, from people
 in each of our ridings, from people right across the province.</span></p>

<p><span id="para984">We have to work together. We have an opportunity 
to work together, to collaborate, to make their lives better, to make 
the province better. But to do that, we have to be here. We will get 
through this, one way or the other. We will have tremendous challenges 
on the outside, at the end of the COVID-19 experience. But we have to be
 prepared when we come out of this, and that’s why it is so critical to 
sit in this House, to be prepared to open up the economy and to be 
prepared to help all of the sectors—small businesses, large 
businesses—once we do reopen our economy.</span></p>

<p><span id="para985">We need to put measures in place so that when 
restaurants can finally open their doors or have to open patios, 
literally perhaps making their profit margin extremely small, 
contributing to the challenges that they’ve already faced—we want to 
ensure that this government is prepared for all of the businesses that 
will be sacrificing through COVID-19 and afterwards. But again, in order
 to do that, in order to put measures in place, we have to be in this 
Legislature.</span></p>

<p><span id="para986">I can almost hear now the Leader of the Opposition
 in November standing and saying, “Why weren’t you prepared? Why didn’t 
you do anything during the COVID-19 crisis? You knew that restaurants 
would be suffering. You knew that clothing stores would not survive. Why
 didn’t you have things in place?” We’re telling you now that we need 
your co-operation because we need to put measures in place to ensure 
that people can recover.</span></p>

<p><span id="para987">As the parliamentary assistant for job creation, 
economic development and trade, I meet regularly with businesses across 
Ontario, and they are sharing ideas. They are telling me what they would
 like our government to do. They are giving recommendations that I want 
to bring to this Legislature in hopes of ensuring that their businesses 
and all businesses can survive and thrive after COVID-19. But again, in 
order to do that, we have to be here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para988">One of the committees that I’m sitting on is the—I
 hope I get the acronym right—SCOFEA, the Standing Committee on Finance 
and Economic Affairs. We’ve already met. We’ve already met virtually. 
We’ve had our first conference, our first call, and we will be moving 
forward with many, many, many, many stakeholders in different sectors 
over the course of the next few months. The finance committee normally 
travels across Ontario and meets with representatives, but we know that 
COVID-19 has created a new reality. In many ways, it has actually 
provided opportunities to stakeholders to participate. Not everyone has 
an opportunity to drive to where the committee is meeting, whether it’s 
in Timmins, Ottawa, here in Toronto or in Kitchener. But virtual 
meetings are giving more stakeholders an opportunity to share with all 
members of this Legislature—the opposition; I believe the member from 
the Green Party; and of course government members—their concerns, and 
what they would like us to do. This opportunity, through our Zoom 
conference that we are going to be holding over the course of the 
summer, will give these people a voice all across Ontario, right in the 
most northern part of Ontario, southern Ontario, eastern and western 
Ontario. All sectors, all ages, all time zones—it doesn’t matter—all 
times of the day: They can participate. I think that what they have to 
say is so critical to influencing all of us as we move forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para989">Members of the committee will be listening, will 
be taking notes, will be submitting our recommendations, and many of 
those recommendations are going to help us as we move beyond the 
COVID-19 crisis. They will be new times, untested, uncharted, but we 
have to be prepared for when we move beyond COVID-19, when we finally 
come out of this.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para990">1520</span></p>

<p><span id="para991">We must be prepared, because, as I said, I know 
that in your role as opposition, you’ll be challenging us: “What did you
 do? Why aren’t you prepared?” The member from Windsor–Tecumseh and I 
both come from a media background, and I hear the opposition so often, 
and in many ways it is very similar to that of what media members do: 
They question, they challenge. But they also want you to provide answers
 and to be proactive and to follow through with what you say you’re 
going to do. You must come up with solutions. That’s what we will be 
doing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para992">We will be reaching out to our stakeholders 
through virtual committee meetings. We will be meeting here regularly 
through the course of the summer to discuss these particular pieces of 
legislation and other pieces of legislation and other comments, and we 
will be finding solutions, hopefully collaboratively, so that the people
 of Ontario, who have suffered the greatest crisis, probably, of their 
lives, can see some sort of hope through all of this. They need to trust
 us. They need to know that we are here for them and that we are working
 for them.</span></p>

<p><span id="para993">I started by saying, as we all have, that it is 
truly, truly a privilege, an honour, to be able to work in this House, 
to be able to have a little bit of authority that makes a difference 
during the worst crisis in the history of this province. We have to stay
 here. We have to work during the next few months to ensure that 
Ontarians understand that there is hope. We have to give them hope. We 
have to show them.</span></p>

<p><span id="para994">I’m hoping, as many members have said, that we can
 show them that we will somehow put the partisan politics aside and 
recognize that they come first, the future of this province comes first,
 and that we will work together to ensure that it is a better Ontario.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para995"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para996"><strong><span id="P1017_281098">Ms. Catherine Fife:</span></strong>
 It has been a very interesting couple of days as we’ve come back to 
Queen’s Park. I have to say, I don’t think that the citizens of this 
province are very much interested in the parliamentary circus that has 
happened here yesterday or this morning. For their information, and, of 
course, for my parents, who are always watching, I want to let them know
 that we’re debating a motion brought forward by the government, with an
 NDP amendment, to sit for the summer. There was a night sitting motion,
 but there was a typo in it, I guess, or something like that, and so it 
didn’t come forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para997">Our amendment to summer sittings throughout June 
and July also has the additional day, and so, for everyone’s 
fact-checking here in the province of Ontario, our motion has more time.
 We are actually advocating that MPPs work longer throughout the summer,
 and we would welcome pieces of legislation that the government could 
bring forward which would deal with anything to support the economy, 
especially commercial rent relief, in particular. I just had a phone 
call with a small business in Waterloo called Ctrl V, and they’re pretty
 desperate. I’ll talk a little bit about them in a second.</span></p>

<p><span id="para998">I’d also like to talk about emergency staffing 
levels that need to be addressed for our retirement homes, 
long-term-care homes, the private homes that are operating under the 
radar here in the province of Ontario, and our most marginalized and 
special-needs citizens who are off in group homes, who have sort of been
 left off the whole conversation here in Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para999">That’s just to set the record straight. The people
 of this province want us to be focused on addressing this pandemic. 
That is why we are in a state of emergency. We should be in a state of 
emergency. To date, in the province of Ontario, we have seen 2,155 
people die from COVID-19, and 1,587 of those people, citizens, died in 
long-term-care homes—1,587. That number just came out two hours ago. 
That is a scathing reflection on our long-term care and our retirement 
home system.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1000">So I think we have a responsibility. There’s a 
lot of talk today about what our responsibilities are. Our 
responsibilities are to respond to this pandemic, to ensure that our 
province has the resources it needs to fight COVID-19, and also to set 
us on a path for recovery. I can see why some of the antics that 
unfortunately happened over the last two days would be a really nice 
distraction for this government. They don’t really want us to talk about
 the report that came out yesterday, which really shed a light on 
long-term care. It’s a harsh light. It is a hard report to read.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1001">My friend and my colleague from Windsor–Tecumseh 
talked about the conditions that were reported by the Canadian military.
 My friend and colleague from St. Catharines asked a question this 
morning about how this government is going to responsibly and deal with 
compassion—the Canadian military, who have declared that they will have 
post-traumatic stress disorder from being in our homes, from witnessing 
seniors who have been neglected to the point where you wouldn’t—if 
people saw pets and dogs and cats being treated like that, they would be
 outraged. This is a point in our history of our province that is a 
shameful place for us to be in.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1002">If people watched question period this morning, 
the official opposition, as is our responsibility and as is our role, 
asked the Minister of Long-Term Care and the Minister of Health and 
called on them for a level of accountability that we have not seen to 
date, from the Premier as well. We asked the minister—and if you heard 
her answers, you would be left dissatisfied. You would be left angry. 
You would be left doubting the competency and the level of expertise 
that currently exists in that ministry.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1003">At one point, the minister says, “We are 
committed because you can tell by our commitments.” That’s a direct 
quote from this morning from the Minister of Long-Term Care. “You can 
tell that we’re committed because you can tell by our commitment.” That 
does not instill confidence, Mr. Speaker. It does not.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1004">It’s a big thing to call for the resignation of a
 minister. It doesn’t happen a lot. We don’t do it a lot. In my eight 
years that I’ve been here at Queen’s Park, it has happened a couple of 
times. And actually, governments have responded. They’ve recognized: 
“Okay, listen. What happened was wrong. We need to reset. We need to get
 fresh eyes and fresh competencies into that long-term-care sector.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1005">People are scared, as they should be. The 
principles and the character of individuals matter. This particular 
Minister of Long-Term Care is well established and well on the record, 
of her own volition, supporting privatized long-term care, supporting 
privatized health care. She has publicly said, and this is from one of 
her own tweets, “Ontario has short-sighted legislation that currently 
prohibits private provision of medically necessary care.” That was from 
February 17. Another tweet: “I’m waiting for the loud nursing union 
voices to say private health care is bad ... wait for it ...” This is 
the Minister of Long-Term Care. She goes on to say in another tweet, 
“Some politicians and health execs tell me that private health care must
 come, but they won’t say it publicly.” Then, again: “Not even Cuba has 
single-payer care.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1006">This is the minister who believes in privatizing 
health care. Why does that matter? That would be a good question to ask.
 I want to say that so far, the deaths in for-profit homes are eight 
times higher than deaths in publicly operated long-term-care homes—eight
 times higher, Mr. Speaker. So that does matter. There is a 
significantly higher death rate as a result of COVID-19 in for-profit 
versus not-for-profit municipal homes. The facts matter. They do.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1007">1530</span></p>

<p><span id="para1008">If we have a long-term-care minister who has 
advocated for the increased privatization of a system that has clearly 
failed our seniors, that causes us to question the competency. It’s a 
big ethical issue for us as a Legislature, so we would welcome more time
 in this place to debate the state of our long-term care.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1009">This is not the first time we’ve raised this. My 
bill Till Death Do Us Part was brought forward in the fall. It was the 
bill that shone a light on the fact that people who have been married 
for 70, 60, 50 years are not able to spend their last years together 
because the long-term-care system had been contracted out.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1010">The Liberals, and now the Progressive 
Conservative government, had truly abdicated their responsibility of 
care for our seniors, the very people who have built this province. To 
that point, the minister should know that under the former Liberal 
government health care in the province of Ontario had already been 
contracted out and privatized to the tune of 40%. And that includes our 
lab services, which affects our testing, which affects our ability to 
trace and to contact.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1011">One of the first cases that I dealt with when I 
was first elected in 2012 was the lab that had watered down chemotherapy
 drugs. Do people remember that? Yes. When profit and making money is 
the driver in the health care system, the citizens of this province 
lose, and we have enough research, we have enough evidence, to confirm 
that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1012">To date—and it’s important to get these numbers 
on the record—82% of Canada’s COVID-19 deaths have been in long-term 
care; four out of the five deaths in this country and in this province 
have been in long-term care.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1013">We currently have outbreaks in over 300 homes in 
Ontario. When this first began, and this seems like a long time ago, 
Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon—you’ll remember that. It’s a 
beautiful community. My parents are from Peterborough, and we spend a 
lot of time up in that area. To see one of the first interviews with a 
PSW, who exclaimed, “How are we supposed to keep these people safe? 
There are four seniors in a room.” They couldn’t access testing. It was 
basically just leaving people—knowingly, intentionally, as a 
government—in those circumstances and not bringing in your own 
provincial powers, which said that a hospital could overtake that home. 
Imagine if that had happened right away. Imagine if that iron ring that 
the Premier talks about was real. Imagine if that actually had action 
behind it and it wasn’t just a sound bite.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1014">The important piece that we are going to be 
advocating for, which we have always, with our health critic, Ms. 
Gélinas from Nickel Belt, and our long-term-care critic, is a system 
that actually takes care of people and that invests in people. The only 
way that we’re going to get there is with a public inquiry.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1015">The reason that our leader and our party are not 
going to back down on this—and we have the support of the people of this
 province. Mark my words: They are not going to forget if this 
government does not honour that, because a public inquiry is about 
justice. The constituent I talked to last week, who shared the story of 
her uncle dying at Forest Heights home, the Revera home that I mentioned
 this morning when I asked a question of the Minister of Health—in that 
home in Kitchener, 50 seniors have died—50 mums, 50 dads, 50 aunts, 50 
uncles. Mr. Speaker, this is unconscionable. It’s a number that doesn’t 
even resonate with you.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1016">But I will tell the government members that there
 is precedent for a public inquiry. SARS killed 44 people in 
Ontario—public inquiry. Elizabeth Wettlaufer murdered eight people, with
 no oversight—public inquiry. Walkerton: Six people died because of a 
system breakdown around water quality—public inquiry. Ipperwash, Dudley 
George—public inquiry.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1017">So, Mr. Speaker, if you think that we are going 
to back down on asking for justice for those 1,587 long-term-care 
deaths—if you think that we’re going to back down from that, you have 
another think coming. We will sit midnights, mornings, afternoons, 
August, September, whatever you want. This motion, which sets committee 
work for legislation that has nothing really to do with the state of 
emergency that we’re in right now—if you think that we’re just going to 
go along with this and not talk about long-term care and not talk about 
the system breakdown when privatization and profit trumped the health 
care of our citizens, then you really don’t know who we are, because we 
are not going to give up on that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1018">The research that has come out of the Interfaith 
Social Assistance Reform Coalition and the Ontario Health Coalition is 
quite shocking, actually. As of May 6, they had confirmed that 9% of the
 deaths in long-term care happened in for-profit. For not-for-profit, it
 was 5.25%. In municipal, it was 3.62%. So just to—</span></p>

<p><span id="para1019">Interjection.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1020"><strong>Ms. Catherine Fife:</strong> It’s so fun when they heckle.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1021">When you compare it with numbers of beds, in a 
for-profit setting—28% of the deaths happened in for-profit homes, in 
not-for-profit: 14.15%. In publicly run municipal homes—and this is 
really key, Mr. Speaker—the increase was actually a decline. So when you
 factored in the numbers of beds in a municipal home, municipal homes 
did so much better. Do you know why they did better? They did better 
because of their staffing ratios. They didn’t allow, as this government 
did, PSWs to be so poorly paid and so poorly treated that they had to go
 from home to home to home. In municipal homes, the working conditions 
are those of a valued professional community. The wages are commensurate
 with the work that they are doing—which are primarily women, I want to 
say, Mr. Speaker. The levels of care are documented, and there are 
levels of accountability there. And profit taking is not part of the 
equation, so at the end of the day, the profit is not the driver for the
 kind of care that people receive.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1022">When we consider this and when we consider how 
community spread also happens, it’s important to note that those PSWs 
who are working in these conditions, and those nurses, the cleaners, the
 cooks—we did not keep those people safe. The government, despite their 
claims, did not ensure they had the personal protective equipment to 
keep them safe. And if one of us is not safe, none of us are safe. If 
COVID-19 has taught us anything, it has shown us that our collective 
well-being is connected to each other. If this government doesn’t 
understand that—and, based on the heckling, I guess they don’t. It’s 
important for us to recognize that what happened in long-term care, what
 was revealed by the Canadian military, is so significant that, once you
 bear witness to it—from an ethical perspective, anyone who has 
integrity cannot ignore it. Once you have the knowledge, you cannot 
ignore it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1023">We believe that the economy is also a key part of
 the discussion and the debate that we should be having in this House. 
We do not believe that there’s a false choice here, that either you have
 health care or you have the economy. In fact, the strength of our 
health care system, the well-being of our health care system, is very 
much connected to how we will recover as an economy. To date, this 
government has not shown up for businesses in the province of Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1024">My critic portfolio is economic development, 
research and innovation. I have to say, I was really pleased to see, on 
May 25—was that yesterday? Yes. On May 25, the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, the Retail 
Council of Canada and restaurant organizations wrote an open letter to 
the Premier. Here is some of what they said in that letter:</span></p>

<p><span id="para1025">“Since the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent 
Assistance (CECRA) program was announced, we have been hearing from 
numerous small and medium-sized businesses that many improvements are 
desperately needed to make it work. Even though the” rent relief 
“program just officially started, we already know from our members that 
many landlords will not apply, meaning ... tenant eviction protection it
 includes. To make matters worse, it is extremely easy for a landlord to
 evict a commercial tenant in Ontario.”</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1026">1540</span></p>

<p><span id="para1027">These organizations have been clear for months now and asked again Monday:</span></p>

<p><span id="para1028">“Put in place temporary commercial eviction 
protection for tenants who were in good standing with their landlords 
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic....</span></p>

<p><span id="para1029">“Without your immediate assistance, more 
businesses will be forced to close. In the absence of sufficient 
support, a large portion of the economy and the jobs created by our 
hard-working members will disappear forever.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1030">What, so far, the Ford government has offered, a 
deferral on WSIB and on the employer health tax—they pushed debt down 
the line. Well, small businesses don’t have the pay sheet to sustain 
that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1031">Ryan Brooks, who I was just speaking to prior to 
coming up to the House—they’re a family-run virtual reality business 
near the University of Waterloo. They’ve done everything they can to try
 and save their business, but their landlord won’t participate in the 
federal rent relief. They’ve emailed MPs, MPPs, provincial and federal 
cabinet ministers. I mean, they’ve literally done everything they can. 
They need to open. Some businesses can open safely. That’s also part of 
the equation, Mr. Speaker.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1032">And then the other business, of course, that I 
was speaking to is Woofur. It’s in Richmond Hill, and so I know that 
they’ve reached out to the member from Richmond Hill. I’ve spoken with 
Michelle Tao, as the member has as well. Their landlord is Primont. 
Primont has actually said that they’re going to increase the rent by 
30%. They’ve become very aggressive as landlords.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1033">The federal plan is not working. We need a 
made-in-Ontario plan to save businesses. We need those businesses to 
stay viable so they can access the federal wage subsidy, and we need 
those jobs to stay viable so we can recover as an economy. That’s what 
has to happen.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1034">As of Friday of this week, you are going to see a
 massive loss in businesses if this government doesn’t act. And so we 
will stay here at Queen’s Park Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. 
We will sit for night sittings. We will make sure that we do our job of 
holding you to account, just like we tried to this morning with the 
Minister of Long-Term Care. We’re showing up to work for the people of 
this province. Accept the amendments. Let’s get the private members’ 
business back on the roster, as our deputy House leader has proposed, 
and let’s get to work for the people of this province.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1035"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1036"><strong><span id="P1057_299128">Mr. Billy Pang: </span></strong>I’m
 honoured to be standing here before the House in order to support 
motion number 77, about summer sittings. This motion will authorize the 
standing committees of the Ontario Legislature to begin virtual studies 
on the following bills:</span></p>

<p><span id="para1037">Bill 156, the Security from Trespass and 
Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020, will be studied by the Standing 
Committee on General Government.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1038">Bill 161, the Smarter and Stronger Justice Act, 2020, will be studied by the Standing Committee on Justice Policy.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1039">Bill 171, the Building Transit Faster Act, 2020, will be studied by the Standing Committee on Social Policy.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1040">Bill 175, the Connecting People to Home and 
Community Care Act, 2020, will be studied by the Standing Committee on 
the Legislative Assembly.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1041">Mr. Speaker, we have reached an historic moment 
where all three levels of government agree on one single, unified plan 
for the subway extension in Toronto, which echoes Bill 171, the Building
 Transit Faster Act.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1042">Talking about transit projects and subway 
expansion, I have some data to share with you, Mr. Speaker. Thirty years
 ago, in 1990, it was the NDP government. During the five years of the 
NDP government, 1990 to 1995, no subway station was built—none; zero. 
Under the PC government, the previous PC government—</span></p>

<p><span id="para1043">Interjections.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1044"><strong>Mr. Billy Pang:</strong> Yes, they’re very happy that they built nothing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1045">In the previous PC government, from 1995 to 
2003—eight years—in 1996, Spadina line, Line 1, from Sheppard Avenue 
West to Wilson, one subway station was built. In 2002, Line 4, 
Sheppard-Yonge to Don Mills: Altogether, four subway stations were 
built. So in the previous PC government, eight years, they built five 
subway stations.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1046">Okay, let’s talk about the previous Liberal 
government. From 2003 to 2018, altogether 15 years: Line 1, Sheppard 
West to Vaughan, altogether six subway stations, in 15 years.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1047">Now, our PC government: We have a plan, the 
Building Transit Faster Act. We have a plan of building 12 subway 
stations in 10 years, Mr. Speaker. Obviously, this government has a 
track record and also a plan to move the province forward efficiently 
and effectively. We need to provide more and better transportation 
options for commuters in the GTA. The Building Transit Faster Act will 
provide the province with the tools to expedite the construction process
 that has delayed major projects in the past. The legislation would 
remove roadblocks and give the province the ability needed to deliver 
projects faster. Relocating utilities will be delivered more 
efficiently, while treating business fairly and ensuring costs are not 
passed on to customers or consumers. The legislation will allow Ontario 
to inspect and remove physical barriers with appropriate notification to
 property owners, while ensuring timely access to municipal services and
 rights-of-way.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1048">This motion also authorizes the Legislature to 
sit on a number of days in June and July. And each of these sitting 
days, we will also have question periods to facilitate the important 
responsibility of the opposition to hold the government to account.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1049">The health and well-being of Ontarians is our 
government’s top priority, and as the situation changes, our government 
is continuously monitoring and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. All 
action we have taken to date has been based on the advice of the Ontario
 Chief Medical Officer of Health. Therefore, in order to allow the full 
participation of the members while maintaining safe physical distancing,
 the government is proposing that new voting procedures be implemented 
for the recorded votes in the Legislature.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1050">We will continue to take steps necessary to 
protect all the members, communities, and our loved ones. Since the 
beginning of this pandemic, we have been listening and following the 
advice from our health experts. Our government has moved in swift action
 to ensure the health and well-being of Ontarians comes first. From 
Ontario declaring a state of emergency on March 17, limiting mass 
gatherings to five people; closing non-essential businesses; initiating a
 recommendation of six feet, or two metres, of physical distance in 
public; recommending to the general public to wear non-surgical 
coverings and masks if physical distancing is not possible; to ramping 
up and expanding lab tests and contact tracing—all of this has been in 
an effort to fight the virus and contain the spread.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1051">1550</span></p>

<p><span id="para1052">Mr. Speaker, it is an essential motion to allow 
our government to continue the summer House sitting. While we are doing 
our part in containing this deadly virus, at the same time, Ontarians 
expect that the Legislature will continue to function. And time is of 
the essence. Ontarians expect their elected members of provincial 
Parliament to continue serving their ridings and continue addressing 
their needs and inquiries. Summer sittings will allow the government to 
introduce important legislation as may be required in order to help 
Ontario recover and rebuild in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We 
need to get things moving again in a safe and timely manner and with 
health protocols in place. We will continue to respect the physical 
distancing guidelines and we will seek to continue the limit of the 
number of members in the chamber House.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1053">I have had the honour of serving 
Markham–Unionville, as they elected me as the member of the provincial 
government in the year 2018. As a long-time resident of 
Markham–Unionville, this riding has a very special place in my heart. 
Over the months, I have heard and talked to the constituents of 
Markham–Unionville online, Mr. Speaker. Constituents have reached out 
and shared with me their concerns, their frustrations and their 
uncertainties. To date, I have hosted round tables to communicate and 
hear directly from my constituents—virtually again, blessed by 
21st-century technology.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1054">At my economic recovery consultation round table,
 I was joined by the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance,
 MPP Stan Cho, to hear directly from the business owners of 
Markham–Unionville on the impact that COVID-19 has had on their hard 
work and built businesses. Employee layoffs, commercial rent, revenue 
loss and future uncertainties were the topics and concerns that we 
discussed during the round table, just to name a few.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1055">I have also had the opportunity to host a 
Markham–Unionville parents’ round table, where I was joined by the 
Minister of Education, the Honourable Stephen Lecce, to hear from 
concerned parents and the questions they may be having during the 
COVID-19 outbreak on their children’s education. Some of the questions 
included online learning, summer learning programs, health protocols 
when schools reopen, the next school year, learning support for students
 with special needs, and early childhood programs. I believe that the 
round table offered some clarification and information for parents in my
 community. For questions or themes that did not get the opportunity to 
be answered, I always encourage parents to email or call my office 
instead of using social media because, through the emails and phone 
calls it is a point-to-point communication, person to person, where 
their concerns and questions can be furthermore heard and addressed.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1056">In these uncertain times, I am proud to represent
 the riding of Markham–Unionville. I see businesses, families and 
organizations coming together and helping our province address needs and
 concerns. Take, for example, St. Maurice and St. Verena Coptic Orthodox
 Church, who created a “meals for our heroes” campaign. Through their 
campaign, the meals were sent to York Regional Police and Mackenzie 
Health long-term-care facilities, to name a few, to continue supporting 
our front-line and health care workers.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1057">Chapel Ridge Funeral Home, a local business in 
Markham–Unionville, bought $7,000 worth of personal protective equipment
 and delivered it directly to four long-term-care centres in 
Markham–Unionville, three seniors’ homes and Participation House in 
Markham. The PPE included gloves, gowns, masks, custom-made face shields
 made by the Middleton Group in Markham and vinyl disposable aprons. 
Chapel Ridge Funeral Home was also able to source the PPE through 
funeral supply companies and, in addition, drove to a dental supply 
place in Concord to pick up hundreds of gowns and deliver them to the 
facilities that needed them the most.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1058">Day in and day out, constituents of 
Markham–Unionville come to me to offer their helping hands to the 
community. I couldn’t be more proud of our friends and family in the 
Markham–Unionville neighbourhood, especially during this COVID-19 
crisis, when many of us follow the advice of public health and lend a 
helping hand and also pitch in to help, while showing love and kindness 
during and around this difficult time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1059">As you can see, Mr. Speaker, Ontario is in dire 
need of unity at this unprecedented time, as all three levels of 
government have come together in order to contain and beat this deadly 
virus, while keeping Ontarians safe and working towards a better 
tomorrow for everyone, including students, parents, stakeholders and all
 Ontarians. By virtually passing the above-mentioned motions and working
 on the Building Transit Faster Act, we will in turn make life for 
Ontarians easier while combatting this deadly virus. This is our 
priority.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1060"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Further debate.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1061"><strong><span id="P1082_309432">Ms. Marit Stiles:</span></strong>
 It really is a pleasure to stand here today and speak to this motion. 
When I was leaving the house this morning, my teenage daughters looked 
at me and said, “What’s wrong? What are you doing?” because I was 
dressed for work in a way they hadn’t seen in a while. They only get to 
see it every couple of weeks now with the way this schedule is working.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1062">Of course, it is such a privilege to be able to 
be here in so many respects, first of all because we are able to stand 
here in this House and represent our constituents in the way that we 
have been elected to do, but also, I think, at this particular time, 
when so many people are experiencing such hardship, to be able to bring 
their voices and their stories here to this Legislature, and to also 
acknowledge that we have a privilege in that we are elected, that we are
 receiving a paycheque at a time when a lot of people are losing their 
employment and their jobs.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1063">I have to say at the start that I do find it very
 disconcerting, Mr. Speaker, to hear the government members’ refusal to 
sit just one more day a week over the summer. We know, those of us in 
this House—maybe those watching may not be aware of this, but that is 
the one day when private members’ bills can be debated. So it’s actually
 an opportunity to look at what individual members, on all sides, are 
bringing forward. We could all, I think, come to some understanding 
about bringing forward priority pieces of legislation that will actually
 be really important and do good work in this particular time, so I find
 it very disconcerting that the members opposite would not agree to 
that. I hope they’ll reconsider. I think it would be very important that
 we sit as long as we possibly can in this Legislature, throughout the 
summer, as many days as possible.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1064">1600</span></p>

<p><span id="para1065">I want to acknowledge—I really do believe every 
one of us here; I know how hard everybody has been working. I know how 
hard everyone has been working, because we all get the calls. Our 
staff—let’s hear it for our staff, who are working—</span></p>

<p class="procedure"><span id="para1066">Applause.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1067"><strong>Ms. Marit Stiles:</strong>
 Thank you, yes—from home. They’re working from home as well. They’re 
dealing with the most difficult casework, the most difficult calls, 
people who are really struggling. It happens and it comes in waves. One 
week, it’s a crisis in rent; the next week, it’s, “Where am I going to 
get food?”; and the next week, it’s, “My small business is closing,” and
 it’s just on and on. We are all working, I think, so hard to come up 
with solutions that work for people in our communities. I want to 
acknowledge that because I think it’s really important to say that we 
are all working really hard here together.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1068">I want to say, as well, that one of the things I 
think we’ve all been doing, and I also appreciate as a local MPP how 
important this is, is speaking to all levels of government—working with 
your municipal colleagues, working with your federal colleagues, of 
whatever political stripe, to try to do the best for our communities. 
How important has that been? Speaking with those levels of government, 
working to try to patch together sources of personal protective 
equipment, for example, which we have all, I know, been doing in our 
communities, when those stockpiles turned out to be somewhat fictional, 
when supplies expired or shipments were faulty—the work that has 
happened in our communities to try to patch together solutions has been 
tremendous. Literally, in my community, we are bringing gloves from one 
centre to a food bank and we’re organizing volunteers to do those 
things—and I know that’s happening everywhere—just to make sure that 
those supplies get there, because that’s all that really matters.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1069">We’ve been working with small businesses, the 
very heart of our communities, to signal to the provincial and federal 
governments that the current programs that are being offered are 
failing. They are failing, and they are faulty. They are not going to 
work. Yesterday, I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I spoke with my MP, 
who is a government MP, and I actually raised these issues, along with 
my city councillor, who happens to be the deputy mayor of Toronto. We 
raised some of these issues around constant concerns about whether or 
not this program to support, to provide rent relief, but through the 
opt-in of landlords—how this could possibly work. Because we’ve heard 
from BIAs, we’ve heard from chambers, we’ve heard from small businesses 
directly that this is not working. The response we got was, “Well, we’re
 taking a wait-and-see approach.” And we’re looking at what people like 
Rod Phillips said. It’s the same sort of thing: “We’re just going to 
take a wait-and-see approach. It just opened up. We’ll see.” And we’re 
saying: “No. Don’t listen to us; listen to them if you have to. They’re 
telling us that it’s not working. They’re not applying. It’s a failure. 
Do something else.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1070">We cannot afford to wait. What are we waiting 
for? Because I can tell you that the eviction signs are going up. 
They’re going up across my riding. Every day, there are new eviction 
signs going up on businesses, on storefronts. I get the alarmed calls, 
not just from the business owners, but from the community members.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1071">I want to mention DeSotos on St. Clair West and 
Dave’s. I want to talk about the Lansdowne Cone, which is a great little
 ice cream joint on Lansdowne. They’re trying really hard to work on a 
solution with their landlord. They’re not just a great ice cream spot, 
but they provide important employment opportunities for youth who face 
other kinds of obstacles to employment. They do great things in our 
community. They’re operating, as of today, I think, temporarily until 
June 1. They’re really hoping they can come up with a solution. Thank 
goodness that they were able to reopen. But other businesses are 
reopening and then they’re getting an eviction notice on the door, and 
they are closed again. They have barely had a chance. So we cannot wait.
 We cannot afford to wait for government to decide that now is the time 
when already half of the businesses in our communities have shut down. I
 can tell you, that’s what’s going to happen in large parts of this city
 of Toronto.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1072">It’s very difficult, because these are our 
community members. They’re our neighbours. They’re the little corner 
stores that you get used to going to. They’re the pubs that everybody 
comes together at for their community association nights. These are the 
hearts of our community. We say that all the time. It sounds so cliché, 
but it is so true. It’s also what makes our community so very distinct, 
so it’s very important.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1073">Honestly, if we could work here every single day,
 I’d be happy to. I look around, and I think we’d all do that. Oh boy, 
would we. And I’m sure all of you would too. I think you would. So I 
don’t understand what the resistance is to having that extra day. I 
think it’s really important.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1074">I want to tell you—the kinds of people who expect
 us to come and work that extra day. At the Oasis Dufferin Community 
Centre—it’s called a community centre, but it’s really a community food 
centre—in my community, on Dufferin, north of Bloor. It’s a food bank. 
It’s really operating solely as a food bank right now. The call goes out
 every day for what they need. They need things like diapers because 
there have been babies born in the neighbourhoods—newborns—and people 
need newborn diapers. The number of families lining up has become a 
traffic issue in our community—20 to 30 new families a week accessing 
this one tiny food bank in my neighbourhood. This is very much an urgent
 issue.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1075">And I hear the words of hope and, boy—I tell you 
honestly, I really am an optimist. I really do hope—boy, do I hope—that 
we get through this. But I think we’re just seeing the beginning of it. 
And I think if we don’t act very, very quickly and in profound ways, in 
bold ways, we are not going to get through this. Those families are 
definitely not going to get through this. They want more than words; 
they want action.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1076">What I don’t want to do—I’ll tell you want I 
don’t want to do—is stand here and debate bills that not only don’t 
focus on the issues that we’re facing today, but also bills like the 
housing bill that this government rushed through shamefully, that is 
actually going to make it easier to evict tenants. I was actually quite 
shocked when I heard that yesterday. I could not believe that that would
 have made its way into this House at this moment, when tenants in my 
riding are ending up homeless, when families are losing their homes 
because they’ve lost their jobs because of this pandemic. That we would 
consider making it easier for landlords to evict tenants, that is 
shameful. You should be extending the moratorium on evictions. You 
should be providing direct relief to those tenants.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1077">One of the things that I have been hearing a lot 
over the last little while is that it is not enough to come back to 
“normal” without learning from this current situation. I want to take us
 there for a moment, and I’ll tell you why. The COVID-19 situation has 
pulled back the curtain in many areas for us to see and understand some 
of the inequities that exist in our communities that perhaps have never 
been as obvious as they are now.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1078">I’ll tell you, as the education critic, I have 
looked specifically at education and where those inequities have been 
revealed, because they were always there. They were always there, but 
now, they have become more obvious, and we cannot look back. We have to 
think now about how we are going to address those going forward, when 
our students and our staff, for example, return to school, perhaps in 
September, in whatever way that happens.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1079">I mentioned this today in an opinion piece that 
was published, and I’ve raised this with the minister as well. We need 
to, yes, deal with the nuts and bolts of the issues, but we also have to
 look back and acknowledge the inequities that have been revealed in 
this system: the underfunding, the understaffing, the massive 
classrooms, the capital backlogs, the impact that has on different 
communities. We have to acknowledge that the system wasn’t working well 
for everyone. So if we’re going to go back, let’s talk not just about 
the nuts and the bolts; let’s talk about how we can do better.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1080">1610</span></p>

<p><span id="para1081">I think, very sadly, that COVID-19 has revealed, 
and in the most heartbreaking and devastating way, an issue that we’ve 
raised repeatedly in this House over many years but certainly today, my 
colleagues and I, which is the failure of our long-term-care system, 
and, let’s face it, our failures just generally in terms of taking care 
of seniors and of vulnerable people.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1082">Let’s also acknowledge that this was a system 
that was privatized under the Harris government—privatization was 
expanded extensively under the Harris government. The next government in
 power failed dramatically to do anything to fix it, and now a system 
that, under this current government—and I heard the minister and I’ve 
heard others here today say numerous times, “We couldn’t have seen what 
was coming.” “Oh, my goodness, we didn’t know.” “COVID-19, a pandemic 
like we’ve never seen.” I agree with you there, but I’ll tell you, we 
could have been more prepared.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1083">I tell you, every single day I feel guilt as just
 a member of this society, of our community, for the fact that we did 
not prepare to protect those people in those homes. It is shocking; it 
is appalling. But do you know what? You shouldn’t be shocked that we 
weren’t prepared, because you should have known, because everybody here 
in this House was warned. If you were elected in the last election, this
 was discussed. If you’ve been around in this province for the last 30 
years at some point, this issue has been raised.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1084">I was a researcher in the early 2000s, and one of
 the areas I covered was health care. I was looking at long-term-care 
inspections and nursing home inspections. Let me tell you, these exact 
issues were raised then, and they are raised here again. To say that 
there has been an attempt to fix this is absurd when, at the same time, 
you have reduced the number of inspections so dramatically.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1085">I raise that, and I digress a little, because 
this legislation would move forward the debate on Bill 175, which I 
think is called An Act to amend and repeal various Acts respecting home 
care and community services. I tell you, if there was ever an issue that
 we should be taking a deep breath and looking at really closely in 
relation to the lessons of this pandemic, it is that legislation.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1086">This is not government as usual, okay? I don’t 
think I have to tell any of you that. We all know that. For goodness’ 
sake, let’s learn from what is happening right now: vermin in our 
long-term-care facilities; people reusing needles; and staff who feel 
like they shouldn’t take protective equipment or supplies because 
they’re so worried about budgetary restrictions.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1087">We all know, I think, if it wasn’t clear, why all
 of those workers and all of those experts and we in the opposition and 
many others had been saying for years and years and years that it was a 
problem that the staff in long-term-care facilities and in the community
 sector and in home care were paid so little and didn’t have good, 
strong workplace protection etc.—why that would be a problem in the end.
 It wasn’t just about paying somebody a decent wage and giving them a 
decent job—all those general protections that workers should have—but 
it’s also about the fact that the impact, as we’re seeing now, is that 
people have to work in multiple locations to patch together a living, 
and that the industry, particularly the for-profit side of this 
industry—by the way, again, something that was expanded dramatically 
under the Harris regime, and, in fact, now that former Premier is 
profiting quite immensely from it, I gather.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1088">So you’ve got a for-profit industry that is 
profiting from these centres where we have vermin running rampant and 
where staff are worried about budget constraints and not using 
equipment. It’s astonishing. It makes me very emotional. I find it very 
upsetting, and I’m sure a lot of us do here. Seven hundred people are 
dead. Seven hundred people are dead in our long-term-care homes alone, 
and I think that’s just the residents. I don’t think that number even 
includes the staff; I might be wrong. And we are just seeing the tip of 
this, I believe. I said it this morning, but I really do.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1089">I remember early on, and I felt kind of bad 
saying it because it sounded so doom and gloom, but we saw what was 
coming. It was going to be a massacre in those facilities of the aged, 
of the vulnerable. So don’t say that the alarms weren’t—those flags were
 raised, and that is why we need a full and independent public inquiry. 
My colleague pointed this out brilliantly: SARS, Walkerton, Ipperwash. 
My friends, a public inquiry is going to happen. The question is whether
 or not you are going to be brave enough to do it yourselves, because if
 it doesn’t happen under this government, it will happen under the next 
government. My goodness, I hope it is us and we get to do that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1090">Mr. Speaker, I wanted to share with you, if I 
have a few more minutes, a letter that I shared this morning. I 
mentioned it when I was asking, in question period, the Minister of 
Long-Term Care why she wasn’t resigning. I’ll tell you, again, when I 
was a researcher years and years ago, I remember very clearly a minister
 under the Harris government stepped down. He resigned. It was Bob 
Runciman, a fine member of this House. Bob Runciman resigned. He was 
Solicitor General. He resigned because—I think it was in the throne 
speech—the name of a young offender was written into the throne speech 
and therefore read out. The Solicitor General under that government 
stepped down over that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1091">Can you imagine? It seems almost absurd, in this 
current context. It seems like such a small matter. It isn’t, by the 
way. It’s a very significant thing. But you know what? It is one of 
those things that, as elected officials, and certainly as cabinet 
members, to take responsibility, to say the buck stops here, to be 
accountable—it’s so critical, and it’s critical to the people of Ontario
 to know that you’re taking it that seriously, that there is 
accountability, that there is transparency. It’s absolutely essential, 
and I was very disappointed it didn’t happen here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1092">I have this letter that I sent on April 28, which
 is almost exactly one month ago, and I have not yet received a 
response. This was a month ago, so I listed out a whole bunch of 
examples of people who had contacted me. I was going to read it out. I 
don’t think I have time now. A resident whose 95-year-old father had 
contracted COVID-19 at Mon Sheong Home for the Aged, a home that tried 
and failed to get personal protective equipment from authorities before 
the outbreak and only received it after making the issue public—that 
family.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1093">I’ve also heard from so many, numerous, numerous 
families—I know we all have—who are concerned about ongoing issues, 
about the lack of testing, about the lack of protective equipment, about
 how late the government waited to stop the movement of staff between 
facilities, and the continuation of the movement of staff who were 
contract workers. We need to do better. We need to work here for that 
extra day, because the people of this province expect us to.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1094"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1095"><strong><span id="P1116_328364">Mr. Sheref Sabawy:</span></strong>
 I am honoured to rise today to support the government motion. We are 
adding more sitting time to allow us to move fast to address the issues 
which we need to tackle. Mr. Speaker, all the members of this 
Legislative Assembly have been very busy since the start of this 
COVID-19, especially when it comes to addressing cases and requests from
 constituencies, helping food banks, addressing PPE needs for different 
service providers in their ridings, and participating in various virtual
 town hall meetings to consult or inform our constituents about 
different imminent issues affecting their day-to-day lives.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1096">Problems across the ridings vary from 
tenant-landlord issues to employee-employer issues, health issues, 
seniors’ issues or housing issues. Mr. Speaker, the load of constituency
 cases would double or even at times triple the amount we are used to. 
Conducting and organizing meetings takes more time as we are all 
overwhelmed, especially our ministers, who are doing an amazing job 
during this pandemic. I believe it’s a great initiative from government 
to step up and give this respected Legislature more sitting time to move
 important bills along and aid Ontarians faster and more efficiently.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1097">1620</span></p>

<p><span id="para1098">It would be much easier for us to go back to our 
ridings, but that’s not the way we want to do it. It’s our government’s 
top priority to put Ontarians first, and we would like to be available 
to work day to day to debate different pieces of legislation as needed.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1099">I have a hard time understanding why the 
opposition would be against us working longer for the benefit of our 
constituents. We are requesting to have the Legislative Assembly sitting
 in June and July to make up for the lost time that we incurred as a 
result of COVID-19. But Mr. Speaker, it seems that the opposition wants 
to close it and go home.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1100">Every member of this side of the House is 
involved in their riding, involved in discussions and consultations to 
reopen Ontario for business, and are providing recommendations to secure
 the safety of the people of Ontario. How can we provide the relief for 
the impacted businesses, small shops, restaurants, stakeholders and 
corporations from the hardship that COVID-19 has brought?</span></p>

<p><span id="para1101">As PA to the Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism
 and Culture Industries, we are consulting with all the verticals under 
our ministry to help Ontario go back to business. We conduct weekly 
virtual meetings with municipalities—councillors, mayors—federal MPs, 
health authorities and health agencies, hospitals, community leaders, 
big employers, corporations and different verticals and industries in 
our ridings.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1102">This week only, we did two virtual town hall 
meetings with some of the religious leaders of the Christian faith, 
consulting and getting some recommendations about worship space and 
plans to open the space for worship for 25 different churches 
representing between 100,000 to 200,000 concerned Ontarians.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1103">And despite all this tremendous amount of hard 
work we all put in every day, we are asking to get the chance to do more
 and to continue putting Ontarians first. I would have assumed that in 
extraordinary times of crisis like COVID-19, different parties and 
different levels of government should work together. Put everything 
behind us. The people of Ontario deserve to be, and should be, our main 
concern. Everyone—government, opposition, public service providers, even
 people who are volunteering or donors who are stepping up to support 
Ontario and support our front-line workers—has to work together.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1104">I’m asking the opposition to co-operate now as we
 are one team called Ontario representatives—non-partisan. The people of
 Ontario are watching us. All other provinces are watching what we are 
doing here in Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1105">I want to also remind you that we are in such 
unprecedented times. I want you to ask yourself, 10 years from today, 
did you do enough? Did you represent your constituents to the best of 
your abilities? Did you put the health and safety of your constituents 
above anything else? If any of these answers are no, then we need to 
step up and look for ways to ensure that this is the case. That’s what 
this motion is going to ensure for the people of Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1106">Talking personally, I would like our government 
to be remembered as a government that worked tirelessly and endlessly 
for the health and safety of our constituents. All of us, from our 
energetic Premier, who is all over the map, to our sleepless ministers, 
our members, even our struggling staff who work unlimited hours to 
prepare everything for us—meetings, appointments, calls, information, 
background research, and working on enormous loads of cases. 
Nevertheless, we still want to extend our session so that we can do what
 we were elected to do in the first place: provide a voice for our 
constituents at Queen’s Park and make them our top priority.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1107">Finally, I would like to take a moment to reflect
 on technology and virtualization. Talking from my background of 34 
years in technology, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight 
and praise our government’s vision about the online learning. COVID-19 
showed us that the technology, online virtualization, is ready and here 
to stay and gives us the ability to continue our lives with COVID-19. I 
would like every member here to take a moment to imagine that we don’t 
have these virtual town hall meetings; we don’t have these conferences; 
we don’t have online ordering, online food ordering or online business, 
which we can reach out to from our phones and order stuff.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1108">Talking about myself, I did virtual meetings in 
2000, 20 years ago, so the technology is not lacking. There was a lot of
 fear about taking the step, but it happened. I don’t think that history
 will go back; the clock’s arms never go back. Technology is here to 
help us make our lives easier, to help us do a better job and a faster 
job, and more work to be done. I really commend our government for 
taking the early steps. We asked for only two courses online during the 
negotiation for the education. I, of course, would like to commend the 
Minister of Education for taking the heat for that. Now all the schools,
 colleges and universities are online, and I would like to hear somebody
 objecting about that now. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1109"><strong>Ms. Marit Stiles:</strong> Point of order.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1110"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> On a point of order, the member for Davenport.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1111"><strong>Ms. Marit Stiles:</strong>
 On a point of order, I’d like to correct the record. Incorrectly, I was
 looking at the statistics from April 28 when I referred to the number 
of deaths in long-term care instead of May 27. On April 28, it was 700, 
but the actual number today is 1,587 residents and patients in long-term
 care.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1112"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Thank you very much. That is a point of order, and you have every right to correct your record.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1113">Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1114"><strong><span id="P1135_335965">Ms. Suze Morrison:</span></strong>
 It’s certainly a pleasure to rise in the House today to bring forward 
the voices of the people in my community in Toronto Centre.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1115">Speaker, today I want to talk about priorities. 
Ontario is in the midst of a state of emergency, a global pandemic 
that’s impacting all of our communities in unfathomable ways. We’re here
 debating a motion to move forward with summer sittings precisely 
because we have to figure out how to do our work in this Legislature in 
new and adaptive ways—the same way that our communities are trying to 
find new and adaptive ways to survive the pandemic, to survive as 
tenants, as small businesses and as community organizations, supporting 
the most vulnerable people in our communities.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1116">I’d like to share with this House the priorities 
that I have for my community and that I’m hearing from my constituents 
in Toronto Centre—the priorities that I hope this government brings 
forward over the course of the summer session; the issues that I need 
immediately addressed, immediately dealt with to ensure that not a 
single person in my community is left behind as a result of COVID-19.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1117">1630</span></p>

<p><span id="para1118">Over the summer sitting, I need this House to 
address supports for tenants, many of whom have not been able to pay 
their rent through no fault of their own. I’ve heard from tenants in my 
riding that despite the temporary ban on evictions, they’re still 
receiving eviction notices. They’re worried about what happens when they
 fall behind on rent and what happens when those eviction hearings 
resume at the Landlord and Tenant Board.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1119">This government has done nothing to protect 
tenants during this crisis and has, in fact, made things worse. Just 
this morning, instead of focusing on the priorities that we need to be 
dealing with, this government tried to quietly and quickly ram through a
 bill that will make it easier for landlords to evict their tenants in 
the midst of a public health crisis. Tenants deserve so much better than
 being abandoned in their time of need and to be put on the fast track 
to eviction. It’s shameful, Speaker.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1120">One tenant, Emily, that I spoke to lives in an 
Akelius building. I’m sure many of my colleagues are familiar with 
Akelius. They’re a large multinational landlord that was recently 
rebuked by the UN special rapporteur on the right to housing. Emily’s 
rent is $1,500 for a small apartment in downtown Toronto. I believe she 
said, when we spoke, that it was only about 350 or 400 square feet. 
Emily is currently receiving the CERB benefit. If she were to pay her 
rent in full at $1,500, she would only have $500 left at the end of the 
month to pay her phone bill, to pay her Internet, to buy a month’s worth
 of food. To make matters worse, she recently had to undergo emergency 
dental surgery, a surgery that cost her $1,000 and left her with 
expensive medications.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1121">She didn’t want to fall far behind on her rent, 
though, and so she did her budget and she figured out that she could pay
 $1,100 of the $1,500 she owed her landlord. She made that offer, that 
she was willing to pay $1,100 so as not to fall far behind, and if she 
could make a payment plan to get caught up. Within an hour, she had an 
N4 on her door. An N4 is a notice to terminate tenancy from the Landlord
 and Tenant Board for non-payment of rent. She received this notice from
 her landlord despite the fact that evictions are currently banned in 
the province of Ontario, and for only falling $400 behind on her rent. 
Within an hour she had this notice.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1122">When Emily called the Landlord and Tenant Board 
to confirm her rights, she was told that landlords are just getting 
their ducks in order so that they can evict tenants as soon as they are 
legally allowed to at the Landlord and Tenant Board. They’re already 
lining up in the queues, issuing notices, just waiting for the second 
that the Landlord and Tenant Board reopens. Now this government wants to
 make it even easier to fast-track evictions, and it’s shameful. Emily 
deserves a government with priorities that include getting us all 
through this pandemic and getting us all through this pandemic housed, 
not passing legislation that will hurt our communities more and forcing 
it through.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1123">We need get to work on the actual priorities 
before us. That looks like actual legislated protections against 
evictions. It looks like a rent subsidy for tenants who have lost their 
jobs as a result of COVID-19. And it looks like this government walking 
back your disastrous rent control loophole that’s leaving tenants in my 
communities paying rent increases in a time of a global pandemic, when 
they simply cannot afford it. That’s what I need this House to address 
over the summer session.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1124">Speaker, I need this House to address supports 
for small businesses over the summer sitting of the House. I’m terrified
 about the future of cultural main streets in our communities, like, for
 example, the Church and Wellesley Village in my riding. I spoke about 
that community in question period this morning. The Village is more than
 a collection of shops, organizations, restaurants, cafés or bars. It’s a
 historic space for queer and trans organizing and has offered refuge to
 the 2SLGBTQ+ community for decades in Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1125">It’s a community that’s not just there for the 
people in my riding. It’s a safe haven for queer and trans people from 
all of your communities. When they need that safe space, they come into 
the Village to be themselves, to find their identities, to do that 
organizing work. Queer and trans folks in all of your communities are 
coming here and accessing those safe spaces and those organizations. All
 of your constituents have a space in the Village. The Village is all of
 ours.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1126">The small businesses that I’ve spoken to don’t 
know how they’re going to survive this pandemic. Their landlords are not
 opting into the only commercial rent relief program that’s being 
offered, and many are facing unthinkable decisions, between taking on 
tens of thousands of dollars of debt—in some cases hundreds of thousands
 of dollars in debt—or closing their doors forever.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1127">I’d like to share part of a letter that I 
received from Christopher Hudspeth. Christopher is the owner of Pegasus 
on Church Street. It’s a popular bar and gathering place in the Village,
 and they were forced to close their doors as a result of COVID-19 in 
March. Christopher is also the president of the Church and Wellesley 
BIA. The letter that he sent me reads:</span></p>

<p><span id="para1128">“Small businesses in Canada are extremely 
important to the local economy. All across this country small businesses
 are working hard to stay alive. Many of us will have even more 
struggles to get reopened in the future. Bars and other gathering spots 
will be some of the last to be able to restart. We need help! The other 
government programs have had issues. Many of them have been corrected. I
 ask today that the provincial and federal government step up and fix 
the CECRA program so it will work for the commercial tenants. The 
federal government has put the money aside; give tenants some way to 
access this help if the landlord won’t. Small businesses are the 
backbone of this country.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1129">My community needs more than what this government
 is offering. For a government that likes to chant how much they’re open
 for business and supporting the small business community, I have 
watched you sit on your hands for months and do nothing to support the 
small businesses in my community that are on the verge of bankruptcy and
 on the verge of closing their doors. These aren’t just small 
businesses; these are historic spaces in the Church-Wellesley Village 
that we cannot afford to lose.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1130">My community needs commercial rent subsidies. We 
need a ban on commercial evictions and we need a real plan to save 
cultural main streets like the Village—but not just the Village. We’re 
talking about cultural main streets with mom-and-pop shops that have 
been around for decades, and in some cases generations. They need to 
survive this, and you need to help them survive this.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1131">Speaker, over the summer sitting, I also need 
this House to address the lack of funding and supports for 
municipalities across this province who are struggling to respond to the
 crisis, with limited resources and an inability to run a deficit like 
other levels of government are able to. In my community, this looks like
 municipal shelters that are pushed to the brink. They are over 
capacity, they are overcrowded, they are underfunded, and the dedicated 
staff who work there are doing the very best that they can without 
enough PPE to make their workplaces safe.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1132">The crisis that we are experiencing with COVID-19
 has intersected with the homelessness crisis and with the opioid crisis
 in unimaginable ways. In my community in Toronto’s downtown east, we 
are seeing a crisis on top of a crisis on top of a crisis, and we can’t 
take it anymore. We didn’t have enough resources when we were only 
dealing with the homelessness crisis, with the worst homelessness 
situation we’ve seen in decades. When we were only dealing with the 
opioid crisis, we didn’t have enough resources. Now, when you add those 
layers on top of COVID-19, my community can’t take any more. We need 
help, and you are not showing up with the supports that we need.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1133">The emergency spending that the city of Toronto 
has had to put in place to try to get us through the COVID-19 crisis 
together has pushed the city’s budget to the brink. Unlike other levels 
of government, as I said before, municipalities cannot carry deficits 
the way that provincial and federal governments can. Toronto’s mayor has
 come out and said that he will have to make massive cuts and stop vital
 services in my city if they don’t get the help that they need from this
 provincial government. Speaker, I need this Legislature, this 
government, to prioritize supports for municipalities over this summer 
session.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1134">These are the priorities of my community in 
Toronto Centre, but I don’t see these priorities reflected in the 
actions of this government. So here we are, in the midst of a global 
pandemic, and instead of prioritizing these issues that require our 
urgent attention—like tenant relief, like supports for the homelessness 
crisis, like supports for the opioid crisis, like supports for 
municipalities, and the absolute shame of the situation in our 
long-term-care homes—we’re here debating a motion so that you can 
fast-track several pieces of legislation through this House under the 
cover of COVID-19.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1135">Speaker, while the issues that I’ve spoken to 
here so far are indeed critical issues locally in my community, in 
Toronto Centre, I’d like to focus the remainder of my time today on what
 I see as really the number one issue before this House today—an issue 
that, quite frankly, as the opposition in this House, we are not going 
to let you off the hook on. And that’s the state of long-term care in 
this province, as it directly relates to this bill before us, through 
the time allocation of Bill 175, which seeks to reorganize community 
care in this province in the midst of an absolute crisis.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1136">1640</span></p>

<p><span id="para1137">Really, where attention needs to be today, where 
we need to be fully and completely focused is on the bombshell report 
that we received from the Canadian Armed Forces. This contains a 
heartbreaking picture of the state of long-term care in Ontario. As my 
colleague said before—earlier, my colleague from Davenport—1,587 
residents of long-term-care homes have died as a direct result of 
COVID-19 since this crisis started. That’s 1,587 of our seniors, of our 
elders, our grandmas and our grandpas, our aunties and our uncles—1,587.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1138">I want to start by thanking the Canadian Armed 
Forces for shining a light on what we know has been a problem in our 
long-term-care sector for a very, very long time now. I’d like to read 
into the record a few excerpts, a few highlights—I guess I should say 
lowlights—from this report, because I think it’s important that every 
single member in this chamber and every single person who is watching 
these proceedings from home knows the reality of what’s happening on the
 front lines of our long-term-care homes right now.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1139">When the Armed Forces went into Grace Manor, a 
home in Brampton, where, I have to say, 11 people have died since the 
beginning of this crisis, CAF reports staff moving from COVID-positive 
units to other units without changing contaminated PPE. There was no 
staff break room on the COVID-positive floor where staff could remove 
their personal protective equipment safely. That was from Grace Manor in
 Brampton.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1140">When we look at Eatonville in Etobicoke, 42 of 
our elders have died at Eatonville in Etobicoke. When we look at the 
report, some of the issues that were raised at that specific home were 
issues with isolation, with COVID-19 residents in the home being allowed
 to wander the home and the facility, putting not only other residents, 
but other staff at risk of contracting COVID-19. We saw reusing of 
compromised equipment, including catheters that had been left out on the
 floors. They found nearly a dozen incidents of bleeding fungal 
infections in residents. There were issues with a lack of soaker pads. 
Residents who routinely soiled their bed despite having incontinence 
products were not permitted to have an extra soaker pad or towel in the 
bed to help protect the sheets or blankets from soiling. They were left 
to lay in their own soiled sheets because they couldn’t be bothered to 
give them an extra pad.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1141">There was a general culture of fear among the 
staff, a fear of using equipment because of the costs. We’ve allowed a 
pillar of our health care system to put costs before the care of our 
elders, of our seniors. They also found that key supplies were often 
under lock and key and saw instances of expired medication.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1142">Staff were improperly trained and morale was low.
 There was a really disturbing issue where the staffing is such that 
it’s impossible to provide care that is appropriate to each resident to 
allow them any kind of independence. An example that was listed is that a
 resident states that he would like to ambulate to the toilets and the 
PSW said, “No, I just changed him.” Imagine not even having enough free 
will to be able to go to the bathroom, enough support from the people 
that are supposed to be providing you care to have enough dignity to be 
able to use the bathroom.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1143">When we look at Hawthorne Place in North York, 43
 of our elders have died at Hawthorne Place. The report says that there 
was little to no disinfection being conducted in the facility before the
 CAF arrived. They delayed the changing of soiled residents, leading to 
severe skin breakdowns in multiple residents—forced and aggressive 
transfer, forced feedings, narcotics not being given properly and 
residents having not been bathed for several weeks.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1144">I want you to think about your moms and your 
dads, your grandparents, sitting in a bed, unbathed, for weeks on end, 
and tell me that you think that that’s okay and that you think a 
closed-door inquiry into this is okay.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1145">When we move to Altamont in Scarborough, 52 
people have died at the Altamont facility in Scarborough. This report 
speaks to inadequate nutrition due to significant staffing issues, and 
most residents were reported not having received three meals per day and
 a significant delay in meals. A significant number of residents also 
have ulcers—stage 2, 3, and 4—as a result of prolonged bedrest. It goes 
on to say that at this facility, residents have no way to receive 
additional personal supplies. Since the lockdown, they’ve been unable to
 receive things like shampoo or snacks or the newspaper.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1146">I want you think about what it’s been like to be 
cooped up in our homes for these last months. Imagine not even being 
able to get the shampoo that you need, to get the newspaper to know 
what’s going on in the world, and how disconnected you’d feel in this 
shutdown without these basic creature comforts of life.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1147">In the Orchard Villa section of the 
report—Orchard Villa is a home in Pickering; 77 people have died at 
Orchard Villa—the CAF report said they found cockroaches and flies, 
rotten food, patients left in soiled diapers, an incident of a fractured
 hip that was never addressed by staff and liquid oxygen generators that
 had never been filled, sitting unused in the basement.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1148">Speaker, these are our elders. They deserve the 
highest level of respect and dignity that can be provided to them. Now, 
there’s a path forward here, but you have to be willing to take it. We 
need a full public inquiry into the state of our long-term-care homes. 
We need investigations; we need inspections. We heard this morning from 
the Leader of the Opposition that you’ve slashed inspections of these 
homes across the province, and in the last year, only nine homes of the 
626 across the province have received an inspection. That’s less than 2%
 of long-term-care homes. And then you sit here and look surprised and 
shocked at the results that have been highlighted in this report. This 
is shameful, and our communities deserve so, so much better.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1149">Lastly, I have a few emails from some 
constituents that I do want to read into the record, and I know that I 
only have about a minute and a half left on my time, so I’ll try my best
 to do that. I have one email from a constituent named Paul, whose 
father is in palliative care in a long-term-care home, and he hasn’t 
been able to see his father except through a window since COVID-19 
started. Paul says, “Why don’t you have a public inquiry into long-term 
care instead of an internal review? In fact, Ontario needs a public 
inquiry into our care for the elderly, encompassing the spectrum of home
 care, retirement homes, long-term-care homes and hospitals.” I agree 
wholeheartedly, Paul.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1150">I also heard from another constituent, Cory, who 
lives in the Corktown neighbourhood in my riding. Cory wrote to me and 
said, “I sympathize with those who have a parent in a care facility, or 
have to look after elderly family members at home. The reason for this 
email is to add my support to an investigation, and I hope that all 
aspects of operations are looked into. This is because a family member 
of mine is a front-line worker who, for several years, has not been able
 to find a full-time job, although well-qualified. The main issue is 
that hospitals, long-term-care and retirement home facilities tend to 
offer mostly ‘casual’ or ‘on-call’ work in order to not provide 
benefits. Therefore, workers are forced to take on multiple jobs to make
 a living. I hope that this investigation results in regulations that 
add stability to these workers’ lives, and operational improvements that
 result in improved care of elders.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1151">I want to thank that constituent for their email.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1152">Again, I can see that I’m out of time, so I’d 
like to thank the House for the ability to raise these issues today and,
 again, to the government members: Do better. Do better. I can’t—</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1153"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Thank you. Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1154"><strong><span id="P1175_356519">Ms. Christine Hogarth:</span></strong>
 I’d like to start with just thanking all our paramedics. This is a 
reminder that this is paramedic week. When March break came upon us, it 
was a different world. My friend Gino and his wife, Louise—Gino is a 
paramedic, and his wife, Louise, is a nurse. We had plans to get our 
families—my stepdaughters—together for a March break weekend. 
Unfortunately, when things happened, he was called back to work 
immediately, and we have not seen them since. We actually haven’t seen 
our stepdaughters since, because they live in a different community. I 
just want to thank all those paramedics out there who are doing their 
jobs, looking after us, looking after our loved ones, because they are 
there for us on the front lines. When duty calls, they’re there for us. 
So thank you to Gino and thank you to his wife, Louise.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1155">1650</span></p>

<p><span id="para1156">I also want to thank our constituency staff. Our 
constituency staff have done a lot of work differently, just as we have,
 just as a lot of businesses have. A lot of them are working from home. A
 lot of them are trying to figure it out. Everybody has a different way 
of working. Everyone’s office is different. Every community is 
different. But we represent all of Ontario, so we have to make sure that
 they’re safe in their jobs, and I know we all—it doesn’t matter what 
political stripe—want to make sure our staff feel safe. They also are 
taking their time to work in the evenings; they’re working on weekends. 
And also, don’t forget the staff here in the Legislature who are always 
here to support us. Thank you. Thank you to all of them.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1157">I just want to thank them for their hard work, 
especially my staff in Etobicoke–Lakeshore. A shout-out to Andrew and 
Sujay, who have gone that extra mile to help me and my constituents, to 
make sure when my constituents write in—you know what? Everybody was in a
 crisis. Everyone was concerned. No one really knew what to do, and they
 were there and they helped make sure those emails and those phone calls
 were responded to promptly. So thank you.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1158">We were all elected. Many of us worked our whole 
lives or dreamt our whole lives to take a seat in the Ontario 
Legislature. It is an absolute privilege to be able to sit here in one 
of these chairs. I used to be a staffer here many, many years ago, and 
to see the day that I actually was able to take a seat—someone said to 
me, “There’s no bad seat in the Legislature,” and that’s true. There is 
no bad seat, because we all have the privilege to serve and we worked 
hard to earn these positions that we have, to have that opportunity to 
stand here in the Legislature and debate legislation, debate ideas, 
debate concepts and thoughts that are brought forward to us by our 
members.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1159">That’s why it’s so important that we’re here 
today. It’s important that we’re here throughout the summer to continue 
these debates, because we ran an election with a mandate and those 
people who voted for us expect us to deliver on that mandate. That’s why
 it’s important to continue these dialogues that we have started.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1160">We talk about Bill 171, Building Transit Faster. 
How better is it to have that bill debated now? We need to get transit 
built faster. That’s something that creates jobs. I represent 
Etobicoke–Lakeshore. We need to continue to build our transit hubs. We 
need to contribute. My riding is growing. It is growing so quickly. We 
have to make sure that people can get to work on time. We have to make 
sure that our transit is built so people have a way to get to work.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1161">It’s different when you’re from different parts 
of Ontario. You may not see transit to be as important as we do here in 
Toronto, but that transit is extremely important. We have growing 
ridings. We want to make sure we can create jobs. What better 
opportunity to create jobs, when people are losing their jobs?</span></p>

<p><span id="para1162">Building transit faster helps create jobs in our 
community, and it also encourages investment. Toronto is a hub. We need 
to continue to create these jobs in the future. What better than to 
start getting transit built so we can be attractive to other people when
 they start looking at jobs and where these jobs are going to be? We 
want them to come to Etobicoke. We want to make sure they’re in Toronto.
 We want to make sure that we are an attractive place for people to come
 and work because we know, as members have mentioned, that people have 
lost their jobs. Some of these jobs won’t be there for them in the 
future, so we have to think creatively about what kinds of jobs will be 
in our community. Let’s make our communities more attractive by having 
better transit.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1163">One thing my colleague from Flamborough–Glanbrook
 mentioned was about transfer trucks. Where do those transfer trucks on 
the highway go? Well, they come to the great riding of 
Etobicoke–Lakeshore, because they come to our food terminal. I want to 
do a shout-out to all our folks who work at the Ontario Food Terminal, 
right in my riding of Etobicoke–Lakeshore. They didn’t stop working. 
They continued to make sure those trucks were serviced, and they wanted 
to make sure that that food got to our grocery stores and got to our 
homes. Thank you to everybody who worked very hard at the Ontario Food 
Terminal. You know what? It’s probably getting there a little faster 
with less traffic these days.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1164">My colleague from Flamborough–Glanbrook talked 
about her commute to work. I grew up in northern Ontario. Since 1995, 
I’ve lived here in Toronto. When I tell people that I live 13 kilometres
 from my place of business, which is here at the Legislature, and it 
takes me an hour, they can’t believe it. But that’s fact. That’s a fact 
of living in Toronto: 13 kilometres, one hour. Today may be a little 
different. It may be only 17 minutes—which is great, I appreciate 
that—but it will come back to the day when we will get back to that 
gridlock. We want to make things better, and to do that, we need to 
improve our transit. So I would really like to see this bill get debated
 here in the Legislature.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1165">I don’t think anyone can disagree that our 
justice system is outdated and antiquated. The system is broken, and we 
need to fix it. Our Attorney General has put forward a very good bill, 
Bill 161, which is in the committee stage right now, I believe. It is in
 the Standing Committee on Justice Policy. Wouldn’t it be better if we 
could start having those discussions right now so we can move this 
legislation forward and get this looked at? We can all agree that 
transit needs to be fixed. We can all agree that our justice system can 
be fixed. We can do things better.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1166">As I mentioned, it is an honour and a privilege 
to stand in this House and serve the people of Etobicoke–Lakeshore. I 
believe it is important that we have that opportunity and, since we 
missed a little bit of time, that we take that time in the month of July
 to sit here and continue those debates.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1167">One thing we say to each other—and I’m sure you 
all do in your own constituency: We are going to get through this. We’re
 going to get through this. Life is going to be a little different. We 
have to be patient, we have to be careful and we have to look out for 
one another. I want to applaud our Premier, I want to applaud our 
Minister of Health, and I really want to applaud our Minister of 
Long-Term Care, who has held her position for less than a year, for the 
work that they are doing to protect the citizens of Ontario. We have a 
mandate, we have a goal, we have an opportunity to continue what we were
 elected to do. Yes, COVID-19 happened. We are getting through it, and 
we are getting through it together. We will continue to get through it 
together. We will work with one another to make sure it happens. But 
debating some of this legislation—we have to have life after COVID-19. 
We have to have legislation after COVID-19. We must continue to have a 
future, and one thing we have to have is hope.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1168">One thing our businesses say to me when I have 
these Zoom calls is, “What’s the next step?” That’s why it’s so 
important that we continue having these discussions—because our economy 
has to move. Ontario is the economic engine of this country. It has to 
continue to go. It has to continue to move. And if we’re not here 
debating legislation and moving things forward and getting these ideas 
up, then what are we doing? Why did we run in these elections? We can’t 
let COVID-19 stop us. We have to continue. We have to make sure that we 
have a better future for tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1169">I thank everyone for their time. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1170"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1171"><strong><span id="P1192_365805">Mr. Jamie West:</span></strong> I appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of the members of Sudbury and on behalf of the province as well.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1172">Before I start, Speaker, just in terms of good 
news, I want to share this with the House. I read this the first thing 
this morning in the news. Dr. Penny Sutcliffe, who is our medical 
officer of health in Sudbury for the public health unit, announced that 
she believes that Sudbury is near the end of the first wave of COVID-19.
 We’ve done very, very well on social isolation and following the rules 
from public health. We have very few cases, and we’re doing a very good 
job. I just want to celebrate with the House how well we’re doing in 
Sudbury with COVID-19. I know that we’re having a difficult time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1173">I’ve got some notes written down, and I want to 
talk about the notes in general for people watching—and just understand 
that what has happened over the last couple of days has been sort of 
unique in that, while we’ve been here, we’re in different spots. I 
normally sit over there; now I’m over here. I don’t have access to my 
regular equipment. We usually prepare before we come in. Yesterday we 
had these bills arrive with no notice, no preparation—and you’re on 
House duty and you’re not sure what’s happening. All of my notes are in 
my desk, over there, but I can’t get there because of social isolation, 
so I have to wander through it. Luckily, yesterday, I wasn’t up for 
debate. But I just want to explain how different the tone has been. It 
changed like that. We had this sense of collaboration, working together 
and discussing stuff, and I don’t know what happened to change it all of
 a sudden.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1174">Then, at the end of the day yesterday, we got 
these five pages to cover—this motion out of nowhere. I read it last 
night. I’ve got to tell you, last night—and all of us, I know, work 
hard. I’m not going to throw stones. I might make a joke or two, but I’m
 not going to throw stones. We all work hard. But last night, I was 
doing consultations with working groups about how we get out of COVID. 
This is a request from the government. I’m doing another one tonight and
 I’m doing another one tomorrow night. But on top of that, I’ve got to 
read this five-page debate and prepare for it and get some notes and 
think about it. At the end of the day, when you finish the consultation 
at 8:30 at night, it’s not enough time to prepare effectively to talk 
about what’s best for the province. It’s frustrating, Speaker.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1175">1700</span></p>

<p><span id="para1176">Why are we here? I talked about the five-page 
motion, and I’m not going to go into it. I might later, if there’s time,
 but I just want to talk about the amendment because that’s what we’re 
debating. In the motion, it says, “Let’s sit for three days a week.” The
 amendment basically says, “Let’s sit for four days a week.” The 
government keeps arguing that we don’t want to sit. I want to be very 
clear: We want to sit. We want to sit an extra day. We normally sit four
 days a week. We go back to our constituency offices for Friday and 
through the weekend. What we’re saying is, let’s resume business the way
 we used to. We do want to sit, but instead of three days we want to sit
 for four days, and that makes sense. They had a motion for more sitting
 time. The amendment was saying, “Let’s sit even more.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1177">All the previous debates where people got up and 
read their notes and said, “I don’t know why the NDP, the opposition, 
doesn’t want to work”—it’s not true. You’ve got to listen. We’ve got to 
listen to each other.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1178">Earlier, there was a comment made. I apologize; I
 forget your riding. People aren’t in their normal seats. I know your 
name; I can’t think of your riding, but my apologies. The member 
opposite talked about paramedics. Only half of the room clapped. We all 
are proud of paramedics, but we start getting zoned; we start getting 
isolated and thinking of our team and their team. We’ve got to get out 
of this rut. We want to be here sitting, working and debating. I agree 
with the government that we should be working.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1179">I’ve got to tell you, Speaker: Last year, I 
really agreed that we should have been working, because last year we 
didn’t sit here for five months. I don’t remember a single member of the
 government saying, “We should be here—three days, two days, one day.” 
We were here no days, for five months. So there is a lot of work to get 
done and caught up on, and I want to be here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1180">I’ve got to tell you: I come from a working-class
 family, and I’m proud of it. I’m proud of my roots and I’m proud of the
 people I work with. I have a feeling that this summer is going to be 
like my old job because, before the election, I worked for the smelter. 
We dealt with heat and we dealt with hot face masks and we dealt with 
hard work and long hours. So if you want me to come, I’m coming. I can’t
 wait to be here. I love to be here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1181">I’ve got to tell you: My role there was with safety. We’d start our meetings, where I worked, with safety messages.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1182">I have to tell you—and I’m not saying this in a 
partisan way—what you did during that vote was incredibly unsafe. Those 
masks that you’re wearing, the paper or fabric masks: I come from a 
world where we wore masks because chemicals are dangerous. Those are not
 protecting you. They’re limiting and they’re reducing the risk, but 
man, I’m really concerned about you and your family’s safety. I’m 
concerned with what you did.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1183">I’ve got to tell you: I do love coming here. I 
love it. I feel like this is a place where people like me don’t get to 
come and represent their constituents a lot. We joke around a lot about 
being knuckle-draggers, blue-collar workers, and there’s a bunch of us 
on our side of the aisle. The member from Mushkegowuk-James Bond—Bay; 
that’s even better: James Bond—is a blue-collar worker. The member from 
Niagara is a blue-collar worker. Hamilton—Miller; sorry. Anyway, 
Hamilton East–Stoney Creek is obviously a blue-collar worker. I think he
 has broken every finger he has. They’re all curved in different 
directions. And you get to speak for those people whom you don’t get to 
hear from.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1184">Earlier, there were members across the aisle 
talking about farmers. I’m from a mining town. We have farmers around 
our city, but I don’t know as much about farmers as somebody who lives 
in a farming community. We need to hear all those voices. It’s 
important.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1185">I want to remind you, Speaker: What we’re saying 
in the amendment—the government is saying, “Let’s come to work and let’s
 work hard,” and we’re saying, “Yes, let’s come to work all four days, 
not three days.” We’re basically saying, “Yeah, let’s come to work and 
work hard.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1186">The real reason I think we’re doing this, 
Speaker, the reason we’re having this debate today, has to do with 
long-term care. This report showed up yesterday. It’s pretty damning. 
It’s a little embarrassing. It’s frustrating to me that in question 
period the minister sort of implied that they didn’t know; how could 
they know? I have a newspaper; I knew. Before I was elected, I knew 
because I spoke with families and workers. Workers haven’t been quiet 
about this. Families haven’t been quiet about this. Any of us in the 
last election who were knocking on doors—I know in my city, the top 
three: hydro, health care and long-term care.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1187">There’s a member who didn’t vote for me, a 
Conservative member, when I was knocking on doors, who told me, “I’m not
 voting for you; I’m Conservative. But we have to fix long-term care. 
Those personal support workers are family when family is not there.” 
That sticks in my head. That was two years ago. I still remember. I can 
knock on the same door and tell the person.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1188">Personal support workers are family who are not 
there. We’ve created an environment where they can’t make enough money 
to work in a single place. We don’t treat them properly. I don’t want to
 get into blame, but we’ve got to fix this. We can sit around and say 
this government, the previous government, the one before—we can go all 
the way back. Every time I hear someone say “Bob Rae,” I feel like my 
head is going to explode. I couldn’t even vote when Bob Rae was elected.
 Look how old I am. How far back are we going to go? It’s ridiculous.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1189">I want to tell you a story, Speaker, about 
listening. This is a story from the smelter. I worked with a 
superintendent for years named Rick Melanson. He recently retired, and 
congratulations again, Rick, on the retirement. If I know Rick, he’ll 
probably come back as a contractor, but congratulations for whatever 
week or two you were retired.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1190">So Rick and I were involved with safety for 
years, and we had an issue with lighting. It was dark. You would think, 
with the smelter and the hot metal, it would be bright, but it was dark,
 and there were concerns with lighting. We couldn’t get it around. In 
the early days of LED lighting, Rick took a real bold step and he 
invested in some new lighting. He had people come in on overtime on the 
weekend and put lighting all over the place. We literally showed up on 
Monday morning waiting for high-fives. It was like a John Woo film where
 we’re walking in slow motion with doves behind us.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1191">We were expecting all these people to be excited,
 but we screwed up. We put lights where they were in people’s faces. We 
put lights where they couldn’t see what they were trying to do. 
Everybody was angry at us. That happened maybe a dozen years ago and it 
sits in my head as a reminder to listen—to listen to everybody. Even 
when you think you’re right, you might get it wrong if you don’t listen 
to everybody. We need to listen to everybody.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1192">Members at home, people at home watching this 
might be wondering why we want to go for four days. On the one hand, we 
can have more debate and more conversation, and I think that’s 
important. But on the other hand as well, there are private members’ 
motions, there are private members’ bills. There are some important 
bills for us to discuss and move forward on. They’re valuable. They’re 
important. It’s why we’re elected. A lot of them are brought—my private 
member’s bill this year was brought to me by members of my constituency.
 They told me, “This is what I want from you.” The one I had last year 
about declaring an emergency because of the opioid crisis—it was an idea
 that came from my community. It was from town halls. People in my 
community said, “We need your help. We’ve got to do something.” It was 
their idea.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1193">These are valuable things for us to bring up. 
People expect us to. That’s why they elect us. We’re their voice. We 
amplify their voice, all of us in our ridings. It’s all important to us.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1194">Right now in my riding, the voice I hear the 
loudest is small businesses. They’re the loudest right now. And as we 
march toward the first of the month, when rent is due, or the end of the
 month, when rent is due, their voices get louder and louder.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1195">As a government—I’m not saying this as a 
criticism; I’m saying this as a positive thing: As a government, we shut
 down many small businesses because of COVID-19. That was a bold step to
 take. It was an important step to take. Probably one of the reasons 
we’re celebrating the success in Sudbury that I mentioned earlier is 
because we decided to shut business down.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1196">And they made a sacrifice. They’re losing money 
hand over fist. Their hopes, their dreams, all the things that you speak
 to as values about small business—they’re all true. They’re relevant. 
My mom had a small business. I’ve lived this. I get it. But these small 
businesses are struggling, and they’re desperate for help and for rent, 
and the package that is out there is not working for them. They can’t 
just be phoning my office. They have to be phoning yours as well.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1197">Speaker, they’re so desperate; they’re so 
worried. And when they phone me, they tell me they’re optimistic: “If 
you help me, if you can help me, if the government can help today, I 
know I’ll get back on my feet. I just can’t get on my feet before I’m 
evicted.” We have the power to do this. You want to run through 
legislation? We’ll come back tomorrow and vote it through. Put some 
money in the pockets of these small businesses so they don’t fail. 
That’s what they need from you. That’s what they need.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1198">We’ve been talking about technology, and I 
mentioned to the member across from me here—we were talking about how 
good technology is. In the motion they talk about having people come in 
June to depute, to come and speak and tell their story. The government 
said several times that they can do it by technology. In the north, you 
can’t. I’m in the riding of Sudbury and around my riding—we joke that 
I’m the Timbit and she’s the doughnut; Nickel Belt is the riding around 
mine. I’m on several calls because Sudbury is sort of the hub. Often the
 member from Nickel Belt cuts out because Internet access is so poor. I 
can drive to her house in 20 minutes, but Internet access is poor.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1199">1710</span></p>

<p><span id="para1200">Let’s listen to each other. When somebody has 
access to high-speed Internet, like I do in Sudbury, they need to listen
 to people from other ridings, rural areas, northern areas, who don’t, 
who want to have a voice, who want to depute, but maybe—one of these has
 to do with farming, and I know it’s important because I worked on farms
 as a kid. But I think summertime is really busy for farms. I think 
that’s why they hired me in the summer, because it’s really busy. It may
 not be the best time to come down, especially during a pandemic when 
they’re probably worried about how they’re going to harvest, how they’re
 going to bring people on to the land, how they’re going to care for 
their animals with social distancing. Let’s give them the voice they 
want. Let’s not drive it through because we want to, because it’s our 
party. Let’s make it theirs.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1201">I’m running short on time, Speaker. I had an 
opportunity this morning to have—we ran out of time. I’m not going to 
ask the question, but there’s part of it that stands out to me. I just 
want to read part of it. For reference, both my dad and my grandfather 
are retired from the military. They’re both veterans. I know first-hand 
how brave they are, how hard-working they are—our armed forces in 
Canada. I used to joke all the time that my dad would jump out of 
perfectly good planes. It takes a lot of bravery to jump out of a plane 
that isn’t crashing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1202">Our armed forces went into long-term-care 
facilities, Speaker, and they found stuff that devastated them. They’re 
horror stories. I can’t imagine a soldier being overwhelmed in a 
long-term-care facility, and I’m proud that they brought it forward. But
 we really dropped the ball. We did. Like I said earlier, I’m not 
blaming the government or the previous government or the one before. I’m
 saying we have an opportunity to fix it. If anyone in this room thinks 
that we were elected to blame someone else and not fix the problem 
that’s here, you’re wrong. You’re wrong. The reason there was such an 
overwhelming change is because they were fed up and they wanted it 
fixed. That’s what they want from us: to fix it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1203">I was distracted working on notes for this 
because I keep thinking of the other work that we’re doing. I keep 
thinking of COVID-related things in my riding and ways to help people 
connect. I keep thinking of people trying to educate their kids while 
working from home—those who are fortunate enough to be working from 
home. Other people are trying to figure out how they’re going to put 
food on their table for their kids. Other people are worrying about how 
they’re going to pay for the Internet, because they need the Internet 
now so their kids can go to school—and the struggle and constant stress.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1204">I keep thinking about my friend who told me that 
his wife, who’s a nurse, goes to work all day incredibly stressed, and 
on the drive home is relaxed for about 15 minutes, and spends the next 
15 minutes of the drive home worried about what she’s going to do when 
she gets home. She goes into the garage and washes herself with Lysol 
wipes, puts all of her clothes into a bag in the garage and hopes she 
doesn’t give it to her family when she gets home.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1205">That’s the reality for people in Ontario. That’s 
what they want us to work on and focus on. When you tell me the priority
 for people in Ontario right now is TTC subway stops—my apologies to the
 Toronto members, but unless you’re running a spur line to Manitoulin 
Island, that’s not the priority. I can’t believe that in Toronto, people
 are calling their MPP and saying, “When are you going to expand the 
TTC?” They can’t be. I keep hearing members talking about small 
businesses closing down, people losing their livelihoods. I don’t know 
how people make ends meet. I don’t know how it happens. These are things
 that we can tackle and we can fix. When we talk about expanding, coming
 here for four days instead of three, those are the things we can tackle
 and we can work on. That’s what we should be doing together.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1206">I just want to talk about a couple of things in 
the original motion. There’s a whole motion about a voting procedure, 
and I want to talk about that, because it’s important in terms of why we
 want to debate, why we want to have things ahead of time, to fully 
understand them. I read this and it didn’t make sense to me.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1207">Right now, when we vote, we stand here and we all
 stand together. We saw earlier how that could be hazardous with 
COVID-19. The motion, basically, is that we’ll vote in the lobbies. 
There are rooms behind here, and we’ll vote in here. I don’t understand 
how we would do that. I don’t know how we’d socially isolate. It 
probably makes sense to the government, and I want to listen to them and
 understand how it makes sense, but all I have is this piece of paper. I
 can’t wrap my head around it. How will we figure that out? How will I 
walk there and back without coming into contact with somebody else? I 
could have COVID at any time, like any of us could.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1208">The very first case of COVID in Sudbury was 
someone who was around 50 years old, who was at the PDAC conference in 
Toronto. I’m around 50 years old. I was at the PDAC conference in 
Toronto. I spent 14 days in Toronto before going home, because I didn’t 
want to bring it to someone at home. You don’t know; you might have it. 
So we’ve got to take the precautionary principle and ensure that we 
don’t have it.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1209">The other thing I saw in here—I’m going to run 
out of time. I want to keep others safe, as well, and keep our staff 
safe. I want to keep our table Clerks and our security safe. There was 
something in here that caught my eye, and I thought it was funny. Just 
give me one minute; sorry, Speaker. Do you know what? I’m going to skip 
over it. There was something in there that caught my eye, and I thought 
it was funny. It was just the wording of it, but it’s not worth sharing.
 What’s important right now is the debate that we’re having about the 
amendment.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1210">We want to come to work. I know sometimes we sit 
on different sides and we think that whatever party is different, 
they’re not as hard-working or smart or whatever it is as us. I know 
you’re here to represent your constituents. I know it. I talk to you 
guys all the time in the hallway, and I know how busy you are. You’re 
saying, “Let’s come to work through the summer. Let’s make up for lost 
time.” We’re saying, “Yes, but instead of three days, let’s do it four 
days.” Let’s be proud of the work that we’re doing. Let’s work as hard 
as Ontario is going to have to work to get back on their feet, because 
there’s no one in Ontario who is going to say, “Yeah, you guys really 
crushed it with your three days a week. You’re really working hard.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1211">Obviously, Speaker, I’m speaking in favour of the
 motion. I support the motion. Let’s get back to work. Let’s do the hard
 work that people expect from us. Let’s continue to work hard, four days
 a week.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1212"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1213"><strong><span id="P1234_387599">Mrs. Nina Tangri:</span></strong> It’s my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak on today’s motion, introduced by our esteemed member from Barrie–Innisfil.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1214">Speaker, I don’t doubt for one moment that all 
members of this House wish to represent their constituents and their 
needs. We were all elected to ensure that the business of this 
House—that is, to pass legislation to improve the lives of all 
Ontarians. Our government was elected with a mandate to build better 
transit, which affects many members in the opposition and would allow 
them to get from point A to point B in a much better way.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1215">As we’re going through such a trying time with 
COVID-19, allowing the Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly to
 study Bill 175, Connecting People to Home and Community Care Act, 2020,
 should be at the top of mind for the members of the opposition. As I 
said earlier, I truly, truly believe that all of us in this House are 
here to represent their constituents, and I’d like to take a moment just
 to speak a little bit about the areas where people in the community 
have really stepped up during this very difficult time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1216">I worked with many different community agencies 
and organizations. We’ve helped raise funds for, as an example, the Yogi
 Divine Society. They’ve been providing groceries for families and 
international students. We’ve donated food to Eden Food for Change, with
 GlobalMedic. The Queen’s Manor event space, for example, gave the food 
bank a chunk of their space so they could store a lot of their items 
that are used for wintertime. They’ve taken that there to open that 
space up for those needy families who need to have that right now. I 
think it has just been amazing, some of the work that a lot of the 
people have been doing here.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1217">1720</span></p>

<p><span id="para1218">The Canada India Foundation: I’ve joined them 
numerous times to provide and continue to provide meals to our 
front-line health care workers all across the GTA. They’ve included 
hospitals, long-term-care facilities. They’ve been to the police and 
gave it to them, the paramedics. We really want to thank them for their 
ongoing services.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1219">And as we heard earlier today, there are many 
members across this House that have done so much work during this time. 
My esteemed member from Mississauga–Lakeshore has done an unbelievable 
amount of work each and every day. Not once, but many times, he has gone
 out with people in the truck to the Ontario Food Terminal, picked up 
food, delivered to food banks, delivered to organizations. It has just 
been so reassuring and so comforting to see members of this House do 
some great here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1220">Our member here from Mississauga–Malton: He’s 
been working with Sai Dham Food Bank, delivering meals with them 
continually, each and every day. It’s times like this where we look 
around in our communities, and sometimes people who were very affluent 
before are very needy right now, and vice versa. It’s very, very, very 
difficult. So to see a lot of people just around this House and the 
community come together to support each other is very comforting. It’s 
times like that where I’m so proud that I’m a Canadian and I’m Ontarian,
 and that I live in a place where we don’t have to worry about where the
 next meal is coming from, because somebody will be there to help. So 
thank you to each and every one here that’s been doing that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1221">But also, Speaker, my staff and I continue to 
support and work with, of course, our constituents. In order for us to 
fully represent those we serve, we need to also be here in this House to
 introduce, to debate and to pass legislation on important issues. 
Earlier, we heard from our House leader about the work we continue to do
 whilst we’re not in the House. I’ll give you a small sample of the work
 and the round tables that I’ve hosting over the last two months.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1222">Initially, right after the House rose, I hosted a
 round table with the Mississauga Board of Trade with the Minister of 
Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. At that time, we had no 
idea what was going to be happening with our businesses. He was there 
and comforting to those businesses. They’re from a very wide range of 
different types of businesses, large and small. It was something they 
needed to hear from the minister at that time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1223">Since then, since we announced the joint economic
 recovery committee, I hosted another one with the Mississauga Board of 
Trade and heard from them. I asked them to let me know and let our 
government know what they could be doing in their industries to allow us
 to reopen. For example, I’ve talked to barbershops, I’ve talked to 
faith communities and just many different areas on what they could be 
doing for us to be able to—with the health and safety, of course, of our
 constituents—open up again.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1224">I moderated a conference call with our Minister 
of Tourism, for those who are in the tourism industry. We all know 
that’s an industry that has been suffering dramatically. There are no 
flights going. People have only been receiving vouchers and not refunds.
 It really has been a very difficult time for anyone in the tourism 
industry right now, but they did give us some fantastic feedback. They 
came back to us with ideas and solutions, which are what we really need 
to be saying. It’s not just the complaints, but real, real solutions, so
 I really want to thank the minister for the great work she has being 
doing and is continuing to do. We hosted another one with her on 
high-performance sports, and that was very successful, to listen to ways
 and we can try and find ways that we can reopen those in the sports and
 fitness industry.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1225">One morning—it was quite difficult because of the
 time difference—to continue to still do the work in our office of the 
Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, I was talking 
with a member of our trade office in India, with a company that is 
interested in investing right here in Ontario, a very large investment. 
So we spoke numerous times, and sometimes it was seven in the morning 
for me here and late at night for them, and sometimes it was vice versa,
 but we do it. We do it because we know that we need that investment and
 we need that confidence in Ontario for those people to come here and 
invest.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1226">I spend a lot of time working with people in the 
media to make sure that the information that’s getting out to the public
 on COVID-19 is accurate. It changes, and not just daily; it sometimes 
changes by the hour, so we need to make sure that we are up to date on 
the information coming out from our government, from the Chief Medical 
Officer of Health, and that we’re passing that information on to the 
public in an accurate and important manner, so that’s something that’s 
been continually going on, each and every day.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1227">I’ve been working a lot with students and 
families and just helping them manoeuvre things like some of the 
government supports that are out there right now. We have the CERB; we 
have the wage subsidy; OCECRA, as we call it; different loan programs. 
It can be extremely confusing, whether you’re an individual or a 
business. There’s always going to be someone who doesn’t fit into any of
 those categories. Each individual, each family, each business is very 
unique. There have been, for a lot of it, some small businesses that 
just did not fit into any of those categories. I agree with the member 
from Sudbury that there are going to be some falling through the cracks,
 and we really have to be there for them.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1228">I really want to thank our Premier, who has been 
working with the federal government, day in and day out, on talking 
about supports for those people in Ontario, and across this country, 
quite frankly, and really pushing to make sure we do get those supports 
for everyone who needs them. So I really wanted to thank him. I want to 
thank our Minister of Health and our Minister of Long-Term Care, who 
have really been out there working for all of us. It’s been comforting 
knowing that they are there all the time.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1229">The six MPPs from Mississauga—we talk amongst 
ourselves at least on a weekly basis. We have calls. We talk about 
what’s happening. We hosted a virtual town hall with our Minister of 
Finance to talk about the industry. Anyone was able to come in and call 
in and ask questions. We actually received a lot of—it wasn’t just 
questions of us. They were giving us feedback on things where we as a 
government could help. I know our Minister of Finance really took that 
information and we’ve moved with a lot of those.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1230">We have a weekly update with the Trillium Health 
Partners—not just the Mississauga MPPs, but also our esteemed member of 
Parliament from Etobicoke–Lakeshore, because one of the hospitals falls 
in her riding as well. Every Friday, they give us an update on capacity 
and the patients, how many are in ICU, how many are on ventilators, and 
where we are on potentially reopening elective surgeries. We’re up to 
date on that information so that we can take that information back, 
again, to the public and reassure people that we’re there, we’re working
 for them and we’re available. We’re always available for our 
constituents.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1231">But I also, Speaker, spent a lot of time speaking
 to companies who have really stepped up to the plate during this time; 
for example, to build ventilators and personal protective equipment. I 
want to talk about a company called Medtronic, in the south of Brampton.
 It’s a global company, and one of the things they build is ventilators.
 Because the ventilators are actually manufactured in Ireland, they had 
to prioritize where the ventilators—where they were making 300 a week, 
they’re now making 1,000. So they had to prioritize globally where they 
were sending them. Of course, it was, first, Asia, Africa, then Europe, 
and now North America. They weren’t able to meet our demand quickly 
enough, so they gave their intellectual property to us and allowed 
companies to take the specifications of the ventilators and build them 
right here. Danby have taken that and worked with a number of other 
companies to build those ventilators. They’ve been built and are at the 
bedsides in hospitals, ready to use if needed.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1232">So when we look at how the people of Ontario and 
the companies of Ontario have really stepped up to the plate, it has 
been quite amazing watching all of this happen.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1233">I know everybody, probably, in the House—all 
members have heard from constituents about only being able to fill a 
prescription for 30 days rather than a 90-day supply. We know that 
supply can be an issue. I actually took time out to speak to Jim Keon, 
the president of the Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association, to 
talk about the drug supply. I asked: Do we really have a drug supply 
shortage on generic drugs? Is there a real issue out there? It’s 
unfortunate that we’re asking our seniors to not go out, yet they’re 
only able to get a 30-day supply, so now they’re having to go three 
times where they would only normally go once for that supply. He said 
that we don’t have a shortage right now, but the issue that we face is 
the logistics. Not all of our generics are manufactured here in Canada. 
If it’s coming from China, for example, or from India, there’s that 
logistical issue of, first, are they willing to let the supply out of 
the country; and second, how many flights are coming out of there—and 
the very few flights that are coming out there, to secure that space on 
that flight to get those drugs out. So as of now, thankfully, we don’t 
have an issue, but we had to have that supply only at 30 days just in 
case. It really has been difficult for many. I’ve had a lot of seniors 
who have contacted my office with this issue alone—because we’re not 
talking about one drug, in some circumstances, for many seniors and many
 people, it could be two, three or more drugs, as well. So that was 
something I wanted to reach out and talk to him about.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1234">1730</span></p>

<p><span id="para1235">I also held virtual meetings and conversations, 
for example, with Bayer. They’re partnering with the Population Health 
Research Institute to launch a trial to prevent health decline in 
COVID-19 patients. They have a study of chloroquine, azithromycin and 
betaseron, which could potentially prevent hospital admissions and the 
need for ventilation. For those of us who may get COVID-19, to take that
 at an early stage—and early trials are looking very promising on that. 
We’ve heard from many different trials that are taking place across 
Canada right now and here in Ontario, but also globally, that are 
showing great potential, but we are in early days. We don’t have a 
vaccine yet, we don’t have a cure, but we’re looking to those in the 
industry to work hard for us and try and find a way to help us all with 
COVID-19.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1236">I also held a virtual round table with Life 
Sciences Ontario on how the sector can contribute to Ontario’s 
post-COVID-19 economic recovery. That included pharma, medical 
technology, regenerative medicine, venture capital and diagnostics. I 
truly believe that we need to work diligently with the sector to build a
 much-longer-term strategy. We need to learn from COVID-19 and what we 
faced and what could potentially happen in another pandemic, and be 
prepared.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1237">We’ve talked a lot about personal protective 
equipment. I don’t think many people in this House heard that term that 
much before COVID-19, but it’s something we talk about each and every 
day. Now we have to understand, as we’re reopening the economy, how 
important it is to have that PPE for everyone. We’re not just talking 
about N95 masks, but the masks that some of us—I think everyone in the 
House has worn a mask today at some point. But now, as we’re opening 
businesses, as we’re going to the stores, as businesses are going to be 
working, manufacturing is going to be open, factories are going to be 
open, people are going to need masks, gloves, goggles, visors, whatever 
it may be, so we need a much larger supply. So we’re looking to industry
 to build that, and build that supply right here in Ontario. I think 
it’s really important.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1238">I’ve spent quite a bit of time picking up and 
delivering masks myself to hospitals, long-term-care facilities and to 
community members.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1239">Soon after COVID-19 began, I picked up the phone 
and I called a company called Kruger to inquire about the possible 
shortage of what was important to all of us, which was toilet tissue. We
 had heard a lot about hoarding taking place as soon as COVID-19 began, 
so I called them—they’re in my riding—and had a great conversation with 
them. I said, “So do we have an issue with toilet tissue?” And they 
said, “For the normal general supply, there’s absolutely no issue. The 
problem that we have is that people are hoarding it. They’re buying it 
and taking it off the shelves, which means some people are not getting 
the supply.” Anyway, I think we’re okay for now on toilet tissue, so 
that’s really important. I actually spoke to them just a couple of weeks
 ago, so our supply is still in good shape.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1240">I have spent time speaking with fitness and gym 
leaders, barbers, faith leaders from every denomination. For a lot of 
people, being able to go to church, to the temple, to the mosque, to the
 synagogue—sometimes that’s the only social interaction that they have. 
So for them to be able to visit those places is so important. What do we
 as a government, what does our Chief Medical Officer of Health—how can 
we reopen these institutions so that people can once again get back to 
practising their faith together as a community? They’ve been coming back
 to me with some great ideas and great solutions on the one-way-in, 
one-way-out, on having two or three congregations where they would 
normally only have one. It’s heartwarming when you see people come 
together and bring you some really great information.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1241">I’ve had conversations with our Peel police just a
 couple of days ago, with the deputy chief, Marc Andrews, who gave me an
 update on where we’ve been hearing a lot about domestic abuse going up.
 However, because people are stuck at home, sometimes there’s no access 
to a phone where they can actually call for help. There are a lot of 
different sides to what we’re hearing.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1242">Neha Sharma, a pharmacist, has a compounding 
licence. In her own pharmacy, she made sanitizer with 95% alcohol—great 
quality. We took them ourselves and delivered them to our great 
paramedics, who we’ve been talking a lot about today, and to a 
long-term-care home in my riding.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1243">I spent time, soon after being elected, and 
shadowed some PSWs in a long-term-care centre. I can’t tell you how—I 
understood how difficult it was, the job that they do, and the immense 
amount of respect we all have for our PSWs. I think there’s a lot of 
work that we can do, we need to do and we must do to support those in 
that industry.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1244">I know there’s not much time left, so I’m going 
to be very quick. But Speaker, I just want to say again that I’m so 
proud of my colleagues in this House and the work that we’ve all been 
doing in our ridings. I know that we’ve also just come through Ramadan 
and Eid, and the Muslim community has been really stepping up to the 
plate and supporting the community with food deliveries and helping out 
our food banks. I know that.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1245">I’ve just mentioned some of the few virtual 
meetings that I have done and I will continue to do, but we must always 
continue to govern to help get through this difficult time—and we will 
get through it. But I do ask the opposition to work with us for the 
benefit of all of the people in Ontario.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1246">Once again, to all the members of this House, 
thank you for all the work that all of you are doing to support all of 
your communities. Thank you for the opportunity for me to rise today.</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1247"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> Further debate?</span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1248"><strong><span id="P1269_406743">Mr. Michael Mantha:</span></strong>
 It’s always a joy to take my place and be here in my seat, away from 
the beautiful riding of Algoma–Manitoulin, but definitely speaking on 
behalf of the good people. I need to inform the people back home that, 
indeed, the tone has changed here at the Legislature.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1249">I want to go back a little bit so that we can 
just piecemeal some of the issues that have happened over the last 
couple of months that have brought us to this point we’re at. There are a
 lot of things I’d prefer to talk about, but I think it’s important to 
give a little bit of that history so the people back home can look at 
and get a better appreciation of what has led us to changing this tone.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1250">I’m so happy that my friend across the way—I 
stood with him I believe it was yesterday. Was it this morning that we 
stood in front of the mace and we complimented each other with regard to
 how all of our colleagues were working extremely hard in their ridings.
 And although we weren’t in our seats here at Queen’s Park—the work had 
changed, but the level of work and the amount of work was still the same
 for all of us, whether we were here at Queen’s Park or back home in our
 offices. I remember we had a very extensive conversation in front of 
the door, where he actually informed me that he recognized a lot of the 
work that my colleagues had been doing back home and the fact that we 
were all working toward advancing and bettering this province. I had to 
share the same conversation with him. I said it’s remarkable that I 
spoke to some of the ministers in congratulating them and making sure 
that some of their staff members—we all have liaison relationships with 
some of those individuals who are behind the ministers and behind the 
ministries, who respond to all of our inquiries, and the amount of work 
that they had been doing. The fact that there was one particular 
individual—and I won’t mention that individual, but I did talk to your 
minister a couple of days ago to give you a shout-out. Every single time
 I called him, he picked up the phone. He had an answer for me, and if 
he didn’t have it there, it was within, I would say, about 45 minutes 
that I got a return call to get those issues resolved.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1251">Anyway, it was nice, because I was standing right
 there in front of the mace with the House leader, and then, this 
afternoon and yesterday, I was dumbfounded with the messaging that he 
was putting out: that apparently, we don’t want to work; that 
apparently, we don’t want to be here. According to his words, the NDP is
 the new NDP as far as what they are looking at doing is wanting to go 
away and not work, effective—I think it was June 3 he had mentioned.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1252">1740</span></p>

<p><span id="para1253">Well, I enjoy being here at work at Queen’s Park.
 I enjoy the work that we can do here. I always enjoy bringing the views
 and the points of people from back home. There’s a lot of gamesmanship 
that has been going on. I often use this term, and I wrote it down just 
to make sure that I don’t forget it: It’s called a bait and switch. A 
bait and switch is kind of, “We want to try to talk about something 
else, to change the channel, so we’re going to put in different subjects
 that we’re going to talk about because we want to get away from, 
really, what is important to Ontarians right now and what is on their 
minds.”</span></p>

<p><span id="para1254">What is on their minds right now is 
long-term-care facilities. What is on their minds is small businesses 
that, after years and years and years of working and building their 
lives and building their relationships and building their business, have
 been left hanging by this government with no assistance, with no help.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1255">The other thing is that there are 1,587 reasons 
why we should be here today talking about long-term-care facilities, 
1,587 reasons why we should be here not just two days a week, not just 
three days a week, but four out of five days a week—and I’m willing. 
Let’s get here and do it in the evening. Let’s take the time that we 
absolutely need in order to get this right, to get the discussions going
 and to get to the priorities that Ontarians really want us to talk 
about.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1256">But what we have here is that we were presented 
with a surprise motion, and what led to this motion is—let’s go back. I 
stated earlier that I wanted to put it into a time frame as to what led 
us here. I remember being in my seat here when my leader, Andrea 
Horwath, was talking about the shortfalls that this government was not 
meeting with the supports and the PPE that we were going to need for our
 front-line workers—our PSWs, our doctors, our RNs, our RPNs, 
paramedics—the shortfalls that were within our long-term-care 
facilities. The reason why we were raising those alarm bells is because,
 an ocean away, there was an illness; there was a disease; there was an 
infection that we really didn’t take the necessary steps in advance to 
prepare ourselves for. It found its way to us.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1257">We had a Premier who stood in this place and 
said, “Oh, you guys are fearmongering. You should be able to go out and 
enjoy, and don’t you worry about it. We have all the PPE that we need, 
and we’re going to sustain. You are fearmongering, and you shouldn’t 
have to worry about this.” Well, lo and behold, not that long ago we 
heard the Premier stand up and say that he was concerned that we were 
going to have some shortfalls on the PPE that is required, and indeed, 
we are still going through that. We still are experiencing 
long-term-care homes, health care facilities, people who are our 
front-line workers who are being denied the equipment that they 
absolutely need in order to provide the proper health care for seniors 
who are in long-term-care facilities or in our hospitals and making sure
 that everything is there that we needed.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1258">It comes in. We’re now into March and now the 
House recesses, and now we put this front, all of us in here together, 
that we’re going to work towards the best avenues and making the best 
decisions for all Ontarians. So that’s what we do, and we go back home 
and we start working towards this. We were one group. We were all 
working together.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1259">Then, something in the tone recently changed. 
What recently changed is the results that we got, and thank goodness 
that the Canadian Armed Forces went into five—only five, Speaker—of 
these homes, and they provided us with horrific stories. There are 
several hundred other homes across this province, long-term-care homes, 
and they were only in five. Now, if there is a reason to have a full, 
independent, public inquiry, there’s the reason. There are also 1,587 
other reasons that we need to have that full, independent, public 
inquiry. But why aren’t we talking about that right now? Because—I go 
back to the term I used earlier—it’s the bait and switch. Let’s switch 
the channel. Let’s put other issues that are going forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1260">In the motion that the government—there’s Bill 
156, An Act to protect Ontario’s farms and farm animals from trespassers
 and other forms of interference and to prevent contamination of 
Ontario’s food supply. There are a lot of important issues that need to 
be dealt with in that bill. But is this the time that we need to talk 
about it, right now?</span></p>

<p><span id="para1261">I know that I’ve reached out to my farm 
communities, and I’ve had the opportunity to chat with them. But this 
bill never came up once as an urgent matter that they wanted to talk 
about. But do you want to know what they did talk to me about? The Risk 
Management Program and the fact that they’re still waiting for this 
government to live up to the 40% of their commitment that they had said 
they would put towards the risk management. Beef farmers are selling 
their meats at a third of the price that they were getting last year. 
That’s an urgent matter that they want to talk about.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1262">During these hearings, as well—there are going to
 be virtual hearings. Our deputy House leader talked about the 
challenges of these hearings that we’re going to have and the fact that 
these are untested. Here’s the reality—the member from Sudbury mentioned
 it a little bit earlier, and I know my friend from Mushkegowuk–James 
Bay will also attest to this. In northern Ontario, we have farmers, we 
have cattlemen, we have agricultural people, we have cash crops. We have
 all kinds of farmers, all kinds of agricultural industry throughout 
northern Ontario. But the thing we don’t have is consistent and reliable
 broadband Internet, where individuals would have the ability—because 
we’re in June, and everybody has been forced to make drastic decisions 
in regard to, “How am I going to plant? What am I going to plant? How am
 I going to be able to bring my produce to the processors?” We’ve seen a
 lot of alarming news that has come up in regard to major producers that
 are no longer in operation. We see that happening in other provinces. 
We see that happening in other countries.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1263">How is that going to impact us? It will, and 
there are some severe discussions and severe impacts that this will have
 on our food chains. Those are the types of things that I’m hearing from
 the agricultural sector, that they want to talk about.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1264">I’m not trying to take away from Bill 156. It is important, but it is not a priority right now.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1265">We have Bill 171, an act to enact the Building 
Transit Faster Act. Heck, I’m from northern Ontario. Can you just try to
 snowplow our roads properly? That’s what I would like to see. That’s a 
priority. We’re going to be in June in a couple of days, so that’s what I
 would like to see.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1266">Over the course of the summer, we’re going to be 
talking about Bill 175, respecting home care. My colleague from 
Kitchener-Waterloo, she just provided me with a very good note, which I 
put right here—here it is. You would think that in the middle of the 
pandemic that we’re in right now, the focus would be on long-term-care 
homes. She provided me with this little footnote: In the 2019 annual 
report of the Auditor General—chapter 3, I believe—the Auditor General 
identified a food diet of $1.77 per day per resident as the increase 
that the government had offered. It doesn’t sound like much, 
right—$1.77. Was that adequate? Is that not something that we would like
 to have a greater discussion on? And, oh, that $1.77 was not just for 
the food; it was for other elevated costs that were within the entire 
industry. Is that something that we want to open up a parade and say, 
“Wow, it’s fixed”? No, it’s not. It gives us greater cause to have 
further discussions.</span></p>

<p class="timeStamp"><span id="para1267">1750</span></p>

<p><span id="para1268">The amendment that we have put forward is one 
that we’re asking to—let’s have more discussions. Let me go on to the 
purpose and the role that we all want to do while we’re here, which is 
the Thursday afternoons, where we do have the ability to expand our 
discussions here, where we as an opposition can bring new subjects to 
the discussion and not just have it be downloaded to us by the 
government. This is a majority government and they have that ability. 
This government, with a majority, has the ability to do as they see fit,
 as they want, and they have been and they will continue to do that. 
I’ve accepted that, as an opposition member. I will continue to voice my
 views. I will continue to bring the opinions and share the concerns 
from people that I represent across northern Ontario, whether they 
support me as an NDP guy or not. I do go out to those doors and I’ll 
take the calls where we can agree to disagree. But I will continue to 
bring those views forward.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1269">The fact that we’re not talking about the crisis 
or having more discussions in regard to the crisis that small businesses
 are going through—I don’t have his authorization for me to share his 
business name or him as an individual, but I will share the story. At a 
family-run business, he had over 40 employees prior to COVID-19. He had 
been 27 years in business. His ultimate ask from this government is, 
“Help us. Give us something. We can almost get by, but we need some 
help.” Some of the federal government grants coming down and the funding
 that is there are not meeting their needs. They need this province to 
step up. After 27 years, they’ve used all of their reserves that they’ve
 had. They’ve now utilized the dollars that they’ve had set aside for 
retirement. They’re faced with the choice of, “We might as well just 
shut down, because when we do reopen, or if we do reopen, we’ll be 
reopening at, what, 50%? Our fixed costs are going to be the same. Our 
business won’t be able to sustain it. So what happens to our family?” 
When they say “family,” they’re looking at all their family of 40 
employees. So how do they proceed?</span></p>

<p><span id="para1270">I’m surprised that we’re not talking about more 
challenges. There are many issues that I have in my riding, and I’ll end
 off with one story from a young lady who’s struggling. She’s a single 
mom. She has her son with her. Her son was diagnosed with cancer. She 
comes up to Toronto from Espanola every two weeks. She’s very fortunate.
 Her name is Kaylie Bond. They travel up here, they do their treatment 
and then they go back. Her employer has been very accommodating to her 
and provides her with the leave that she needs in order to get up here.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1271">She has done everything right and she continues 
to provide as best as she can for her child, but she’s faced with the 
ultimate challenge of not having a home in the next couple of months. 
Why? Because due to reasons that are not fully understood by her, her 
landlord has put in an eviction notice, and she’s going to be forced to 
move out of her home.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1272">One of the challenges that she has is finding a 
new home as a single mom in the Espanola area. She has gone to the 
banks. They won’t provide her with any help because she needs 25% down. 
She has looked at her parents because her parents have a business of 
their own, but they don’t have an actual salary. They can’t get a bank 
loan. She has done everything. She has gone to Habitat for Humanity. She
 has done everything that she possibly can. I’d like to be talking about
 how we help a person like Kaylie.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1273">On Thursday afternoon, going back to the motion—I
 wanted to end with the amendment to the motion that we put forward. We 
need that extra day. I’ll tell you a couple of the reasons why—for the 
success the member had in putting her private member’s bill with the 
defibrillators. I remember putting a private member’s bill myself which 
provided grandparents with the opportunity to have access to their 
grandchildren. We had unanimous support for that bill in this House, for
 something that was in the best interests of the child, to provide them 
an opportunity to visit with their grandparents. There are lots of those
 that have gone around this House, but those are the things that we do 
on Thursdays in private members’ business.</span></p>

<p><span id="para1274">Again, we don’t want to be here just to occupy a 
seat. We want to be here, as everybody else is, to work through this. If
 there’s one reason to be here which is going to be the most important 
thing over the next few days to come—there’s not just one; there’s not 
just two reasons; there’s not just three. There are, to date, 1,587 
reasons why we should be here, and that number is growing.</span></p>

<p class="procedure"><span id="para1275"><span id="P1296_422999">Debate deemed adjourned.</span></span></p>

<p class="speakerStart"><span id="para1276"><strong>The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Rick Nicholls):</strong> It is now close to 6 o’clock. This House will stand adjourned until Tuesday, June 2, at 9 o’clock.</span></p>
