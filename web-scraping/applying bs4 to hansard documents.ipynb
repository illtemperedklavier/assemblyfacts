      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " Ms. Khanjin has moved government notice of motion number 77. I’ve been \n",
      "advised that there is a typo in the motion. It should say “Thursday, \n",

      "The Deputy Clerk (Mr. Trevor Day): “Thursday, June 17.”\n",

      "Ms. Andrea Khanjin:\n",
      " Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As you see by this motion, when our government \n",
      "got elected, we hit the ground running to accomplish so much for \n",
      "Ontarians. When I was knocking on doors and talking to many of my \n",
      "constituents, they often said, “What does the government really do for \n",
      "us? How can they achieve progress? We see a lot of debate, we see a lot \n",
      "of bickering, and we see a lot of things in the debate. What about grand\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",

      "going to be dealt with—they will have heard the government House leader \n",
      "say that, given that we have never in this Legislature held virtual \n",
      "committee meetings before, we would do sort of a trial run, that we \n",
      "would bring forward a single, relatively non-contentious bill—for \n",
      "example, a bill like the Legislative Assembly Act, a bill that was dealt\n",
      " with rather quickly in this Legislature because there was widespread \n",

      "the five long-term-care homes that they were deployed to because of the \n",
      "coronavirus. What the Canadian Armed Forces uncovered was unspeakable. I\n",

      "feeling, how they are processing this information, and how they must be \n",
      "filled with worry and, quite frankly, disgust.\n",
      "Mr. Logan Kanapathi:\n",
      " Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Throughout these challenging times, we have \n",
      "all witnessed incredible acts of kindness, generosity and compassion in \n",
      "our communities.\n",
      "Mr. Guy Bourgouin:\n",
      " Small municipalities in the north face a devastating fiscal situation. \n",
      "While they all have limited fiscal capacity, small towns must face new \n",
      "COVID expenses and keep up with infrastructure that cannot be shut down.\n",
      " Moosonee, for example, continues to operate the main airport of the \n",
      "James Bay, in spite of having lost most revenues. They must keep the \n",
      "airport alive because they serve medical, flood, forecasting and cargo \n",
      "operations. Also, most northern municipalities have taken relief action.\n",
      " Hearst, for instance, paused a tax increase while facing a revenue loss\n",
      " of a quarter of a million dollars between mid-March and April. Other \n",
      "towns have waived interest and penalties, offered payment deferrals or \n",
      "service rebates to small businesses.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser:\n",
      " This pandemic has been hard on families across this province, \n",
      "especially families in long-term care, those families who have someone \n",
      "who is sick and being treated in hospital, and someone who is \n",
      "chronically ill. There’s some risk in this pandemic where we may lose \n",
      "something that’s really important, lose our humanity. One of the things \n",
      "we are at risk of losing is the role of essential family caregivers and \n",
      "the role that they play to keep their loved ones well: sometimes feed \n",
      "them, sometimes bathe them, sometimes avoid medical accidents, to ensure\n",
      " that they get the care that they need. Essential family caregivers are \n",
      "just that: They’re essential. They are not visitors.\n",
      "Mr. Amarjot Sandhu:\n",
      " From the onset of the outbreak of COVID-19, the government of Ontario \n",
      "has taken significant steps to curb the spread of this virus and to \n",
      "reduce its impacts on the health of Ontarians and our economy. During \n",
      "this time of crisis, volunteers and organizations from Brampton West and\n",
      " Brampton have rallied to provide support for vulnerable people in \n",

      "Muslim Jama’at, My Indians in Canada Association, care4cause, Punjabi \n",

      "up to ensure food can reach Bramptonians who need it the most.\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Members’ statements? The member for Scarborough Southwest.\n",
      "Mr. Vijay Thanigasalam:\n",
      " In the fight against COVID-19, the residents of Scarborough–Rouge Park \n",
      "have been more resilient than ever. I want to recognize the incredible \n",

      "Community Association, the Highland Creek Community Association, Muslim \n",

      " Since the beginning of the pandemic, people in my community of Oakville\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): That concludes our members’ statements for this morning.\n",
      "Ms. Peggy Sattler:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker. I rise on a point of order. Our lead questions are \n",
      "to the Premier, and the government has not confirmed whether the Premier\n",
      " will be attending today or not. I would ask if the government can let \n",
      "us know if he will be late, and if he will be, we would like a UC to \n",
      "stand down the lead—\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " That’s not a point of order. Again, I would remind the members that \n",
      "it’s a long-standing tradition of the House not to point out the absence\n",
      " of any member. I would suggest, especially at this time, we—but you \n",
      "were asking—\n",
      "Ms. Peggy Sattler: I seek a UC to stand down our lead until the Premier arrives.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " The member for London West is seeking unanimous content of the House to\n",
      " stand down the lead questions for the official opposition until the \n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " The government House leader is seeking unanimous consent to move a \n",
      "motion without notice respecting the voting procedure today. Agreed? I \n",
      "heard a no.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " My first question is to the Premier, whom people deserve to have \n",
      "sitting in his place answering questions today. Yesterday, the Canadian \n",
      "Armed Forces—\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " I’m going to interrupt the leader and remind all members of the House \n",
      "that it’s not appropriate to point out the absence of any member. Again,\n",
      " there’s a reason for it. It’s a long-standing tradition. From time to \n",
      "time, any of us might be away from the House, so it’s a courtesy to all \n",
      "members.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker. In these horrifying times, my first question this \n",
      "morning comes to the Premier. Yesterday, the Canadian Armed Forces \n",
      "presented a devastating report into the neglect and abuse of seniors in \n",
      "Ontario’s long-term-care homes. The report is heartbreaking and \n",
      "horrifying, especially for families and seniors in these homes. I spoke \n",
      "with some family members from Orchard Villa this morning, and they are \n",
      "devastated, not because they’re surprised but because it confirms the \n",
      "warnings that they had been screaming at this government for weeks.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " Once again—and maybe this is the last time, I hope—I’m going to ask the\n",
      " members not to make reference to the absence of any other member.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker, and thank you for the important question. Our \n",
      "government is absolutely committed to transforming long-term care and \n",
      "health care. That is why, all this time, we’ve been transforming to \n",
      "Ontario health teams and to Ontario Health. We’ve taken the \n",
      "long-term-care sector very seriously, understanding the need for \n",
      "transformation. I spent almost 30 years as a family doctor, caring for \n",
      "people—our most vulnerable people—and understanding their needs. That’s \n",
      "what I came here to do.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question?\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Families who read devastating reports yesterday of ongoing abuse and \n",
      "institutional neglect deserve so much more from their government. \n",
      "Instead of acknowledging the role that the cuts and neglect played in \n",
      "creating this crisis, the Premier and his minister offered excuses. \n",
      "Instead of accountability, the Premier blocked plans for an inquiry and \n",
      "defended his team.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again to the opposition for that question. When you look at \n",
      "long-term care, as I have for decades, you understand that our most \n",
      "vulnerable people are in long-term care. The report was appalling; there\n",
      " is no question. How we respond to that now with an independent \n",
      "commission that allows the public to be heard, that allows for public \n",
      "hearings, that allows for a public report, is absolutely critical. Those\n",
      " voices need to be heard.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The final supplementary.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Speaker, a commission is not good enough. That was something that the \n",
      "women from the home that I spoke to this morning actually agreed with. \n",
      "They think a commission is the wrong way to go, and so do we.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again for the question. Long-term care was in crisis before \n",
      "COVID hit. Our government was committed, is committed and will be \n",
      "committed to the care of and compassion for our most vulnerable \n",
      "citizens. I rose in the chamber on March 12 to talk about how this is a \n",
      "time for caring and compassion; it is not a time for vitriol. I will say\n",
      " today that it is a time for finding solutions.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " My next question is also to the Premier. Look, if this was their number\n",
      " one commitment, they have failed miserably. They have failed miserably,\n",
      " and everybody knows it now. We all knew it before. We did here in this \n",
      "chamber, here on the opposition bench, because the previous government \n",
      "failed as well. But now everybody knows the failure in long-term care.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again for the important question. I have said many times that\n",
      " long-term-care homes were on the front lines of this battle with COVID.\n",
      " When you consider the report, it’s very clear that there was a war \n",
      "going on in our homes against COVID—and the fact that the military had \n",
      "to be called in to support these homes, and the staffing shortages that \n",
      "suddenly became magnified many times more when COVID came into the \n",
      "homes. It would spiral into an abyss very quickly, and that’s why the \n",
      "military was called in.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Speaker, the minister stood in this House and assured Ontarians back at\n",
      " the end of February that everything had been done, that they had a \n",
      "plan, that long-term care was going to be fine. And then the Premier \n",
      "talked about “the iron ring” around long-term care. They said they were \n",
      "going to spare no expense on long-term care—all of these empty words \n",
      "over and over and over again, for weeks and weeks and weeks, while \n",
      "family members and residents became more and more desperate.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you once again for the question. Our government has been \n",
      "committed, and you can see that from the very beginning of our \n",
      "government’s commitments. We look at the 15,000 beds that were to be \n",
      "developed and redeveloped. What we’re finding is the ward rooms, the \n",
      "lack of redevelopment, the lack of new space. Our hospitals were also at\n",
      " capacity with hallway health care. This was an entire system \n",
      "reorganization: Ontario Health, Ontario health teams, integrating \n",
      "long-term care into that process so that they could be more integrated \n",
      "with expertise involving infection control and also the expertise for \n",
      "our long-term-care homes so badly needed. Our personal support workers \n",
      "were short in supply. We asked the government to help us streamline that\n",
      " process to make that easier. The staffing crises, the capacity in our \n",
      "hospitals—it all needed addressing, and our government was working on \n",
      "that from the beginning.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Thank you. The final supplementary.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " In February 2019, the Ministry of Health conducted a resident quality \n",
      "inspection at the Altamont Care Community facility. They found that the \n",
      "facility failed to keep the home furnishings and equipment clean and \n",
      "sanitary, walls were covered in food stains, and residents with bedsores\n",
      " were not being properly treated. This resident quality inspection was \n",
      "one of only nine conducted in over 626 homes in Ontario. It was one of \n",
      "only nine inspected. The Premier scaled those inspections back \n",
      "dramatically after private long-term-care operators described those \n",
      "inspections as “red tape.”\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton: Thank you again. These homes were in crisis, and that’s why the military was called in.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Speaker, my next question is also to the Premier—the same Premier who \n",
      "cut funding to long-term care and virtually eliminated long-term-care \n",
      "inspections, who has no right at all at this point in time to be shocked\n",
      " by the state of long-term care, and no credibility whatsoever when he \n",
      "says he will investigate.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thanks for the question. I have to push back. I have to clarify. I have\n",
      " to tell the truth. And the truth absolutely is that the inspections \n",
      "were never stopped. We have done more inspections than ever before.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath: There’s something called facts.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Order.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton: —and I think it’s very important that we clarify, because reality matters. The truth matters.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Thank you very much. The supplementary question.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Well, I would say to the minister and to the Premier: Resident quality \n",
      "inspections matter. They matter. And to take them down to nine a year \n",
      "when we have 626 long-term care homes in Ontario is negligent. It is \n",
      "them not doing their duty as a government.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Members, please take their seats.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. Our government is committed, and that’s why\n",
      " it began with the redevelopment of our long-term-care system. It put \n",
      "almost $2 billion towards building capacity and redevelopment. They’re \n",
      "undergoing a staffing study to inform a comprehensive staffing strategy.\n",
      " We are addressing Justice Gillese’s report and the important work done \n",
      "by the Auditor General as well.\n",
      "Mr. Parm Gill:\n",
      " My question is to the Minister of Education. Parents, teachers and \n",
      "students in my riding of Milton are doing their best in these very \n",
      "difficult circumstances. They’re being flexible, they’re working hard \n",
      "and they’re being creative. I’ve heard from countless parents who find \n",
      "that their kids are best supported when their teachers conduct live \n",
      "classes. This includes Adriana, who says, “As a parent, I would love for\n",
      " my kids to get the live interaction with their classmates and teachers \n",
      "so they can be engaged and actually learning at this time.”\n",
      "Hon. Stephen Lecce:\n",
      " Thank you so the member from Milton for his question and his \n",
      "leadership. I want just to start with a recognition of gratitude to our \n",
      "educators, to our students and parents for rising to the challenge in \n",
      "this truly unprecedented time.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. Parm Gill:\n",
      " Thank you to the minister for the answer. In these difficult times, \n",
      "it’s more important than ever that our education system adapt to the \n",
      "needs of students. This is critical, especially when it comes to mental \n",
      "health. Anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges are on \n",
      "the rise, and tragically, our kids are not excluded from this.\n",
      "Hon. Stephen Lecce:\n",
      " Thank you again to the member for Milton for the question. I know that \n",
      "mental health is a priority for all members of the House, and I actually\n",
      " appreciate my conversations with the critics in all parties and the \n",
      "leader of the Green Party, discussing this very issue. It is why in part\n",
      " the Premier announced some weeks ago an additional $12-million \n",
      "investment to support mental health, to enable our young people to have \n",
      "the strength that they need through this difficulty.\n",
      "Ms. Teresa J. Armstrong:\n",
      " My question is to the Premier. The government spent months saying they \n",
      "were monitoring long-term care closely but yesterday claimed to know \n",
      "nothing of the horrific conditions in our long-term-care homes. The \n",
      "horrifying report from our armed forces comes after the government’s \n",
      "decision to virtually eliminate proactive resident quality inspections \n",
      "in long-term care. The government insisted that this would have no \n",
      "impact on care. In fact, last April, the minister claimed that Ontario \n",
      "has “the most rigorous” inspections “in Canada” and didn’t need resident\n",
      " quality inspections.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question from the opposition. Our government is \n",
      "absolutely committed to long-term care and reforming health care. In our\n",
      " long-term-care system, we are monitoring the homes. We are moving in \n",
      "the right direction. Our homes are improving. There are a handful of \n",
      "homes that have been under exceptional stress, largely due to staffing \n",
      "issues. We use certain criteria to identify red homes versus yellow \n",
      "homes versus green homes. We’ve been actively monitoring that all this \n",
      "way.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question: the member for Brampton Centre.\n",
      "Ms. Sara Singh:\n",
      " Speaker, it’s difficult to believe that this government had absolutely \n",
      "no idea about the crisis in long-term-care homes when conditions like \n",
      "the ones detailed in the Canadian Armed Forces report are happening \n",
      "across this province, including in cities like Brampton. The Premier \n",
      "said himself that he believes that there are also other homes that are \n",
      "impacted.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. In fact, there was a crisis in \n",
      "long-term-care homes. We knew that there was a shortage of personal \n",
      "support workers. That contributes greatly in a time of absolute crisis, \n",
      "like COVID-19.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser: My question is for the Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. We were actively monitoring these homes—as \n",
      "I’ve mentioned, red, yellow, green—homes that were particularly on the \n",
      "radar for staffing crises. We had been taking measures all along in \n",
      "terms of our emergency orders to understand and anticipate how \n",
      "government could move quickly.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser: I was hoping the minister would provide a more direct and specific answer as to when she knew.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " We have numerous eyes watching the homes and monitoring, and making \n",
      "sure that they’re in close contact with the homes, looking at the red, \n",
      "the yellow and the green. These homes were having difficulties; there \n",
      "was no doubt about that. As we called in the military—it takes time. \n",
      "That’s why I can’t give you a precise date.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser:\n",
      " My question again is for the Minister of Long-Term Care. Given the \n",
      "disturbing report from the Canadian military into the conditions in \n",
      "these five long-term-care homes—like these five homes, there are dozens \n",
      "of homes with double-digit deaths across this province. Given that the \n",
      "ministry’s most prominent response to the Gillese report was to only do \n",
      "resident quality inspections—full inspections—in nine out of 626 homes \n",
      "last year, Speaker, through you: How can the minister assure Ontarians \n",
      "that what was reported today isn’t happening in other homes in this \n",
      "province?\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " If you look at the devastating effect of COVID-19 on our homes that \n",
      "were already in crisis situations with staffing going into this \n",
      "pandemic, our government and my ministry were taking every measure \n",
      "possible to address that. We were looking at volunteer portals. The \n",
      "nursing associations were assisting with volunteers. We were looking \n",
      "everywhere for support, and our long-term-care homes need to be places \n",
      "where people want to work.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser:\n",
      " Speaker, why did it take us a month to raise the wages of the \n",
      "lowest-paid workers in long-term care, like other provinces did? Why did\n",
      " we take a month not to have workers working in more than one home, to \n",
      "stop the spread of disease? Why did we wait months and months to give \n",
      "ourselves the power to take over long-term-care homes and then actually \n",
      "do it?\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. I share concern over our vulnerable people \n",
      "in society. Our government embarked on a transformation of care because \n",
      "it understood the need. Ontario health teams integrating long-term care \n",
      "into our acute care setting and into the community: These are absolutely\n",
      " critical pieces as we move forward.\n",
      "Ms. Marit Stiles:\n",
      " My question is to the Premier. Mr. Speaker, back even as the pandemic \n",
      "was just unfolding, sadly, many in the sector—some of us \n",
      "included—predicted that this was going to result in a massacre of the \n",
      "vulnerable and the old. I, for one, wish that that was not true, and I \n",
      "know we all do, but it has come to be.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Thank you.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " I appreciate the anger that you have, and I appreciate your \n",
      "frustration. I look back on the last few months, dealing with our \n",
      "long-term-care system in this COVID world we live in, and it is \n",
      "absolutely heart wrenching, gut wrenching. As a physician who spent 30 \n",
      "years not only looking after our vulnerable people but looking after \n",
      "members of my own family, to insinuate that I sat there and did nothing \n",
      "is absolutely incomprehensible to me when I know the truth; I know the \n",
      "reality. I know the commitment that our government has had. I know the \n",
      "commitment that I have had. That is why I am here, and that’s why we \n",
      "took every measure, every tool, all the emergency orders. Everything was\n",
      " on the table. We acted swiftly and decisively.\n",
      "Ms. Marit Stiles: Resign. Resign.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Order.\n",
      "Ms. Catherine Fife:\n",
      " To the Minister of Health: That answer, though, was not good enough for\n",
      " the people of the province. In Waterloo region, we’ve seen the painful \n",
      "fallout from declining standards in long-term care, like Revera’s Forest\n",
      " Heights home. Fifty residents—50—have died from COVID-19 in this home. \n",
      "Scared and angry families have reached out to myself and the MPP for \n",
      "Kitchener–Conestoga. Why? Because, before COVID-19, families were \n",
      "spending up to six hours a day caring for their loved ones. They knew \n",
      "that there were no minimum standards of care; they knew that the \n",
      "staffing ratios were poor; they knew that there were reduced in-person \n",
      "inspections. Families were holding this broken system together. The \n",
      "health minister was also Patient Ombudsman. She would have heard these \n",
      "serious concerns and the pain from these families. The pain and the \n",
      "suffering of these residents is not subject to cabinet confidentiality.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): To reply, the Minister of Health.\n",
      "Hon. Christine Elliott:\n",
      " As the Minister of Long-Term Care has stressed repeatedly today, we \n",
      "have taken this seriously from the very beginning, putting in place \n",
      "protections for people in long-term care, making sure that we had the \n",
      "personal protective equipment that they needed. It might not have been \n",
      "used by the management in some of these places, but the personal \n",
      "protective equipment was there.\n",
      "Mr. Jim Wilson:\n",
      " My question is for the Minister of Infrastructure. I am frequently \n",
      "contacted by constituents about the need for high-speed Internet in many\n",
      " areas of my riding. One recent email was from Essa township councillor \n",
      "Keith White, who’s concerned about a resident who may lose her Internet \n",
      "service. Like many residents, Keith wants to know what the province is \n",
      "doing about improving service, not removing it.\n",
      "Hon. Laurie Scott:\n",
      " Thank you to the member opposite for his question. While our government\n",
      " has been a steadfast funding partner for broadband projects in Ontario,\n",
      " like the Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology project, known as \n",
      "SWIFT, I’m sure the experienced member opposite knows that providing \n",
      "reliable and affordable broadband service is a responsibility of the \n",
      "federal government. With that being said, I have raised this issue on \n",
      "countless calls with the federal minister responsible, urging her \n",
      "government to join Ontario and our municipal and private sector partners\n",
      " in closing the digital divide that the COVID-19 epidemic has brought to\n",
      " the forefront.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. Jim Wilson:\n",
      " Thank you to the minister. I know that everyone in the House can agree \n",
      "that the need for high-speed Internet is only increasing during this \n",
      "time of the COVID-19 virus, because people are working from home and \n",
      "because of the e-platform for education.\n",
      "Hon. Laurie Scott: I thank you and I accept that challenge.\n",
      "Mr. Michael Mantha:\n",
      " My question is to the Premier. Ontarians know that these problems are \n",
      "not new. Just a few months ago, I sat here in my chair and looked at my \n",
      "leader when, along with my colleagues, we were accused of being \n",
      "fearmongers. Well, the fear is real, Mr. Speaker. Families have been \n",
      "hurting for years because of Liberal and Conservative inaction.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. When I look at long-term care in \n",
      "Ontario—you have probably heard me say that Justice Gillese said it was a\n",
      " system that was strained. COVID-19 came along and broke it.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Supplementary question, the member for Mushkegowuk–James Bay.\n",
      "Mr. Guy Bourgouin:\n",
      " The previous government and this one have been slow to fix the problems\n",
      " with long-term care. Back in 2017, the Auditor General found that the \n",
      "government cut its inspections after it did a cost-benefit analysis of \n",
      "them and found inspections to be too expensive. That change in \n",
      "inspections resulted in a backlog of over 3,000 complaints and critical \n",
      "incidents. This government kept the new system, which has meant the \n",
      "quality of inspections of Ontario’s long-term-care facilities has \n",
      "dropped.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. Issues surrounding inspections have been \n",
      "raised from the beginning of this pandemic. We have multiple types of \n",
      "inspections. We conducted almost 3,000 inspections, as well as \n",
      "inspections of the homes every year.\n",
      "Ms. Judith Monteith-Farrell:\n",
      " My question is for the Premier. Experts have been sounding the alarm on\n",
      " the crisis in long-term care for decades. The Premier cannot pretend \n",
      "that this is the first he’s hearing of it or that he’s shocked, because \n",
      "workers represented by SEIU sent out a cry for help to the government \n",
      "and several times since, asking the government to step up and ramp up \n",
      "and care when private operators turned them away. Just in January 2020, \n",
      "Unifor commissioned the Ontario Health Coalition to produce a detailed \n",
      "report called Caring in Crisis, which they gave to the government. \n",
      "Workers have been alerting the government for years about this \n",
      "situation.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. I do value all these questions. I think \n",
      "they are important times to address the stress and strain that long-term\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The member for Toronto Centre.\n",
      "Ms. Suze Morrison:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker. Both the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario \n",
      "and the Ontario Nurses’ Association have been telling the Minister of \n",
      "Long-Term Care and the Minister of Health about the kind of conditions \n",
      "detailed in the CAF report for years now. They both say that they begged\n",
      " for this government to improve staffing and funding in long-term care. \n",
      "The ONA even said that after calling in the Ministry of Labour to try \n",
      "and fix things, they’ve also had to take this government and some \n",

      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. We have been listening and taking action. \n",
      "When we look at the long-term-care homes, every operator and every home \n",

      " My question is for the Minister of Long-Term Care. Yesterday’s Canadian\n",
      " Armed Forces report on those five long-term-care residences is very \n",
      "alarming. We cannot tell ourselves that these are five isolated cases.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for raising that. We have heard from you and others. That’s \n",

      "Seniors have been living in these horrible situations for too long now.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again for the question. We’ve taken decisive actions over the\n",
      " last months with many ministries, in collaboration with the experts. We\n",
      " are doing that now, and we will continue to do that. This requires \n",
      "investigation, inspections that will require a lens to be put on this to\n",
      " understand how we move forward from this. It’s the infection control. \n",
      "It’s shoring up staffing. It’s making sure that everyone involved is \n",
      "accountable and responsible. I cannot be accountable for COVID, but I do\n",
      " take ownership of what is happening, and it’s incredibly important that\n",
      " we take ownership, that we solve these issues.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennifer (Jennie) Stevens:\n",
      " This is to the Premier. Long-term care is a serious issue for our \n",
      "veterans. The Royal Canadian Legion Ontario Command has been one of the \n",
      "louder voices to this government demanding a public inquiry into \n",
      "long-term care—on deaf ears. Now the long-term-care crisis is also \n",
      "affecting our Canadian Armed Forces members currently deployed in \n",
      "Ontario—35 members and counting. Not only have military personnel \n",
      "contracted the deadly COVID-19 while rescuing Ontario’s broken \n",
      "long-term-care system; now military sources have told reporters that \n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. My heart goes out. I have great gratitude \n",
      "for the armed forces that have come in to support our homes. It was in \n",
      "our time of need, Ontario’s time of need, and they were there. I’ve said\n",
      " before: We are in a war against COVID-19. We are in a state of \n",

      "On the topic of saving lives, we had, yesterday, a\n",

      "\n",

      "needed a defibrillator, but it was not there in time. So his parents—it \n",
      "was a challenging time for them, of course, to mourn the loss of their \n",
      "young son—wanted to do something about it to prevent other moms and dads\n",
      " to see that happen to their children. So many hockey arenas now have a \n",
      "defibrillator. But that same opportunity and possibility to save lives \n",

      "on it as well, and there was support from all around. It really shows \n",
      "you what can be accomplished in this Legislature when we do work \n",
      "together. And hey, we’ve got all summer now to work together, so there’s\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, when we talk about our member, she has been\n",

      "it achieved. The fact that it is going to be saving lives across the \n",
      "province—and that we can look back and say that during this pandemic, \n",
      "yes, the government and the entire Legislature unanimously agreed on \n",

      "this Legislature to bring progress to Ontario, because when you think \n",
      "about it, yes, there is a health care pandemic, but there are huge \n",
      "economic consequences. For the first time, I’ve heard a lot of \n",
      "individuals from all different walks and parties actually talk about \n",
      "businesses and the struggles they are going through. We have that \n",
      "commonality here in the Legislature, wanting to help small businesses, \n",
      "which is great because, as we know, they are the creators of the mass \n",

      "their empty parking lots. They’re empty. Finally they’re coming back, \n",
      "but now that they are able to open their doors, if they have a \n",
      "street-front entrance, they are able to work, so why can’t they expect \n",
      "the same of their elected members? Which is why we are here—to really \n",
      "stand up for them and get things moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We talk about the supply chain. One of the things \n",
      "in this motion is talking very much about the supply chain when it comes\n",
      " to our agriculture sector. I know that in Innisfil—it’s not a surprise;\n",
      " it’s a statistic all around the world: We have more chickens than \n",
      "people. The agriculture sector there is certainly thriving. There’s not \n",
      "going to be a takeover any time soon, I’m hoping, but it is certainly \n",
      "thriving. We have a lot of dairy farmers, and certainly we’ve seen the \n",
      "impacts of dairy within this pandemic, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that our Minister of Agriculture, Food and \n",
      "Rural Affairs—I’ve been on several phone calls and Zoom meetings with \n",
      "him and with my local agricultural workers. These folks don’t get \n",
      "thanked enough, so I want to thank all the agri-food workers, those \n",
      "working at food processing plants, and our farmers. You’ve really \n",
      "stepped up to the plate for this pandemic. I’ve seen countless stories \n",
      "of food bank donations. I know that our colleague from Mississauga has \n",
      "been working with Sobeys to deliver food. We’re calling him our new Uber\n",
      " Eats politician because he’s bringing food to all communities. In fact,\n",
      " in my own community, Nutrafarms is a place that provides local meats. \n",
      "They were able to donate some of their local meats to his efforts to \n",
      "deliver to families. Likewise, we are working with some local onion \n",
      "farmers to get some onions to make some recipes that he’ll be delivering\n",
      " to residents. So you really see how important that food supply chain \n",
      "is.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to address some of the red tape that \n",
      "happens within that food supply chain, and I certainly heard a lot of \n",
      "that through folks in my riding and a lot of farmers, and that’s why one\n",
      " of the things we will be debating this summer has to do with just that:\n",
      " with our agricultural sector and being able to get at some of the red \n",
      "tape that exists within the ag sector, but also to protect our farmers \n",
      "and protect the livestock. I think that a lot of us talk about \n",
      "biosecurity. That’s so important, and that is certainly something we’re \n",
      "going to be doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing we talk about is how we actually \n",
      "transport those goods. We’ve got our member from Mississauga, who is \n",
      "getting in his car and delivering the food, but you need proper roads \n",
      "and you need proper bridges to get those supplies to market. When it \n",
      "comes to infrastructure and transit development of any kind, that is \n",
      "just so important to the entire supply chain, so of course it’s a very \n",
      "big priority. It’s something we embarked on as a province. It’s \n",
      "certainly a challenge, especially when we think about the Toronto \n",
      "Transit Commission and being able to fix some of that movement of \n",
      "people. You can say that that is the service sector, getting people from\n",
      " point A to point B to their jobs, to their loved ones, and to get those\n",
      " support workers to their destination if that’s the method of \n",
      "transportation they are using. They rely on and expect that when they \n",
      "are working really hard day and night and working those night shifts, \n",
      "they have proper transit that gets them to where they need to go. It’s \n",
      "one of the things we’ll be debating again this summer and will be \n",
      "working on, because a lot of those individuals are working and they rely\n",
      " on us to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, again, tying this back to the motion at hand, \n",
      "and thanking all those—something that hasn’t been mentioned a lot, but I\n",
      " know that our Minister of Transportation, our Associate Minister of \n",
      "Transportation, and our workers who are getting us from—the GO train \n",
      "drivers are still operating. The GO train, the GO bus drivers and the \n",
      "Toronto Transit Commission drivers, whether they’re driving the subway \n",
      "or the streetcar—all the stuff that they’re doing. The maintenance crew \n",
      "that are behind all of those efforts—to thank them, because they’re \n",
      "working through this whole pandemic. If there is a call for something \n",
      "that needs to be repaired, no matter what time of day it is, they’re \n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, as parliamentarians, we owe it to them, \n",
      "too, to be here and to be able to work throughout the summer on \n",
      "accomplishments for taxpaying residents of Ontario and all Ontarians. \n",
      "It’s so vital. But I did want to also take that moment to thank those \n",
      "workers because they’re out there, getting many residents to where they \n",
      "need to be, and doing it safely. We’ve seen many examples around the \n",
      "world of how you can use public transit safely. Certainly, all of them \n",
      "are washing their hands or they’re wearing gloves. We’ve heard a lot \n",
      "about, if you are in confined spaces, to wear a mask, and some of those \n",
      "things that you have to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the topic of masks, it’s incredible to see how \n",
      "many people in our communities—I’m sure that all of you have examples of\n",
      " the families that step up to make these homemade masks. I know that the\n",
      " Richardson family—Jennifer Richardson’s husband has been at his sewer \n",
      "this whole time, making handmade masks for everyone in Barrie–Innisfil. I\n",
      " have picked up several masks from him for myself—I have one today with \n",
      "me. Certainly, I wear that when I need to wear it, but I have also been \n",
      "able to pick up masks for our senior communities that are in independent\n",
      " living and in their homes, and they may need those things. They’ve \n",
      "really stepped up to the plate to make those masks. Certainly, we’ve \n",
      "seen many other individuals throughout the riding who have been making \n",
      "those masks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that as I look around to my colleagues, as \n",
      "they were walking in here today some had their masks on. A lot of them \n",
      "were also made in their ridings—homemade. Some of them have personal \n",
      "touches and different colours; that’s really nice to see. But that’s the\n",
      " positive side of things. I think there is a lot of negativity out \n",
      "there. There is a lot of anxiety and stress. We have to hold on to those\n",
      " really positive stories in our community and thank the individuals for \n",
      "stepping up when it comes to this pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of them who may be at home—they don’t have \n",
      "the ability to have a job. Maybe they have applied for the Canadian \n",
      "emergency relief benefit or other things. At least they know that, with \n",
      "the job protection legislation that we passed in this Legislature \n",
      "unanimously with support by all parties, they will still have a job to \n",
      "go to. But all of us also owe it to those individuals. We’re so \n",
      "fortunate to represent the people of Ontario. We have to ensure that we \n",

      " in our province. We just saw yesterday—we’ve got the member for Whitby \n",
      "here. The General Motors plant is going to be making a lot of masks, \n",
      "which is incredible. That is a made-in-Canada and made-in-Ontario \n",
      "solution to this huge problem. But think about the jobs it’s going to \n",

      "They’re screening them. And they can call in; if they have any symptoms,\n",

      "before you walk in to see where the egg production is made and all of \n",
      "that is done, you’ve got to put on layers: You’ve got to cover your \n",
      "shoes; you’ve got to cover your clothes; you’ve got to wear a hairnet, \n",
      "gloves, everything. Think about what’s happening now. Everyone is \n",
      "wearing gloves and covering their face and whatnot. But that’s their \n",

      "Certainly, we were able to walk through and see \n",
      "how amazing his operation was, and, more importantly, how important this\n",

      "there is some sort of infection or some sort of outbreak at his chicken \n",

      "those are animals that you don’t want to see hurt. You don’t want to see\n",
      " them ill, just like you don’t want to see a human ill. Certainly, \n",
      "that’s something that he cares about. You have a lot of cattle \n",
      "farmers—same thing. They don’t want to see their cattle ill because \n",
      "someone has marched onto their property, trespassing illegally, not \n",
      "allowed, and suddenly you have an outbreak there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, now more than ever, this is so relevant \n",
      "and so important because we’ve seen what has happened with the outbreaks\n",
      " in our community with COVID-19, but you imagine what the other side of \n",
      "things are, what happens in our agri-food sector, that you don’t want \n",

      "really it’s just that you take the eggs you want to buy and you drop off\n",
      " the money. It’s the honour system. There’s a little till there to make \n",
      "change if you need change, and you pick up your eggs. But right now, \n",
      "during this pandemic, that area is closed. Again, he wants to protect \n",
      "his livelihood but also the chickens so that there’s no outbreak or \n",

      "really give them much of a reply because we have to take safety and \n",
      "health—utmost importance. Certainly, that takes precedence, but it shows\n",
      " you why our supply chain and the agri-food bill that we will be \n",
      "debating this summer are so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I talked about the Minister of Agriculture—he\n",
      " actually came to Innisfil, and we did a round table with farmers about \n",

      "when we all travel—when we were allowed to travel before COVID-19—if you\n",
      " compare Ontario to other areas, again, you talk about movement of \n",
      "goods, but you also talk about the service sector and movement of \n",
      "people. That has to be seamless. That’s going to have a huge impact on \n",
      "our economy. If we can get that right, that has a direct impact on our \n",
      "economy, and we need that more than ever coming out of COVID-19 because \n",

      "better, faster transit stuff through”—they’ll want to come to the helm \n",

      "\n",
      "They do have a few jobs open now. They’re still \n",

      "official opposition. I want to say at the outset how striking is the \n",
      "difference in tone in this Legislature yesterday and today when you \n",

      "with, again, very, very little notice to the official opposition. The \n",
      "other days that we had met in this place were determined through a \n",
      "process of negotiation and collaboration and consensus. That, Speaker, \n",
      "is how the people of this province of Ontario expect us to function in a\n",
      " democracy in the middle of a pandemic. It’s more important than ever \n",
      "that we have that kind of cross-party negotiation, discussion, \n",
      "collaboration and agreement—agreement on what we should be talking \n",
      "about, what the priorities are of the people who we represent, and what \n",
      "the concerns are that all of us bring on behalf of our constituents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is disappointing, as I said yesterday, that the\n",
      " government has chosen to depart from the way that we have functioned \n",
      "previously. The state of emergency is still very much in effect, and yet\n",

      "notice to the official opposition limits our ability as MPPs to \n",
      "participate meaningfully in the debate and bring forward the concerns \n",
      "that our constituents want us to talk about. But most of all, in the \n",
      "middle of a pandemic, the concerns and priorities of our constituents \n",
      "have shifted, Speaker. People are looking at the most pressing issues \n",
      "that are before them, and the bills that we talked about yesterday \n",
      "really had nothing or very, very little to do with the issues that we \n",
      "are facing in this COVID-19 emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most disappointing things that we saw \n",
      "here yesterday was the government voting against a unanimous consent \n",
      "motion to allow the critic for the official opposition to stand down the\n",
      " lead on Bill 184, a bill that addresses social housing in the province \n",

      "have a lot of knowledge and expertise in their files and who get \n",
      "briefings from the ministry about legislation that is going to be \n",
      "brought forward. It is the critic’s responsibility to do the in-depth \n",
      "analysis of the bills that we are going to be debating in this place. To\n",
      " refuse the opportunity for our critic to participate in the debate was \n",
      "really unconscionable. It was disrespectable to the democratic process. \n",

      "dealing with COVID-19. Interestingly, they are led by women. In \n",
      "particular, Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand is being held up as a model \n",
      "leader, but others—Angela Merkel in Germany; the Prime Minister of \n",
      "Finland—these are countries that operate on a system of proportional \n",
      "representation. In my critic responsibility within the official \n",
      "opposition, that is another one of my critic roles: democratic reform. \n",
      "You have to reflect on the way that an embedded system of proportional \n",
      "representation forces parties to work together. It forces solutions to \n",
      "be worked out that take into account the views of many diverse opinions \n",

      "that the Legislature continue to sit, that the Legislature debate issues\n",

      "Nothing that the government wants to address, that’s set out in this \n",

      "private member’s bill brought forward by the member for \n",
      "Eglinton–Lawrence, but more than that, it was the result of a \n",

      "passage with support from all members of the House, but that shows you \n",
      "the power of private members’ public business. That shows you the \n",

      "the morning that he has to come into this Legislature and constantly \n",
      "just assume that we aren’t here to assist—maybe because we have a \n",
      "different way of doing it. It’s not always what you want when you want \n",
      "it.\n",

      "\n",

      "He gives the examples, and we’ve all talked about \n",
      "this, about how this week, or yesterday, we brought legislation forward \n",
      "and it was passed etc. The difference is—and I don’t know what he’s \n",
      "thinking and why he would operate this way—we weren’t given any advance \n",
      "notice as to what they wanted to debate. And then to say things such as \n",
      "we didn’t want to debate it—people do need preparation time. It’s been a\n",
      " long time. We’ve all been home dealing with the pandemic on Zoom, \n",
      "online, on teleconferences 24 hours a day, seven days a week—all of us. \n",
      "All of us have been doing that work. We haven’t been sitting and not \n",
      "working. None of us have been doing that. We all come here in the spirit\n",
      " of being servants to the public. That means when we’re not sitting, \n",
      "even when there isn’t a pandemic, when we’re in our ridings, we aren’t \n",
      "on break. We’re not on vacation. We’re actually serving the people who \n",

      "\n",

      " things should go, but then so do other people. Where you have to come \n",
      "together—I think sometimes that is where the friction is, how to come \n",

      "that the government wants to move the business of this Legislature, but \n",
      "we are in a pandemic. There is so much going on outside of these four \n",
      "walls, and we have to address those things. Yes, there were agreements \n",
      "made, and if there are perceptions that those agreements are changed, \n",
      "why not come and speak and discuss it, as opposed to bringing the motion\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the bills, I have to say, is Bill 175, and \n",
      "it’s the bill that’s connecting people to home and community care. \n",
      "Again, in the context of a pandemic, putting this bill into this motion \n",
      "to push it faster through the Legislature isn’t a good idea. This is the\n",
      " time that you can take this opportunity to actually look at the home \n",
      "care bill, the Connecting People to Home and Community Care Act, around \n",
      "the pandemic. They have the power to make those changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m sure everyone has talked to home care workers,\n",
      " long-term-care workers, essential workers. We’ve all had these \n",
      "experiences; they’re not unique to any one of us. I spoke to home care \n",
      "workers and they said, “What we do is that we get one mask a day,” and \n",
      "they have to pick them up at the mask depot. That’s what they told me. \n",
      "They’re surgical masks. They get six masks a week if they work six days,\n",
      " and they get them in a brown paper bag. They have to wear one mask all \n",
      "day, and they see—this is what they said—10 different people during the \n",
      "day. And so when we’re talking about that particular description, and \n",
      "then we’re pushing through Bill 175, which is the Connecting People to \n",
      "Home and Community Care Act, again, we have to stop and think about \n",
      "what’s going on during the pandemic, during the coronavirus, and how \n",
      "it’s going to implicate what legislation we’re passing now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these pieces can, of course, be brought \n",
      "back. Again, we just had discussions about how the bills would be \n",
      "COVID-19-related, health-related, that kind of thing—emergency \n",
      "management orders. This is a bill that has a distinction that we can \n",
      "make, so why not bring that bill in? Why not discuss it or debate it and\n",
      " make sure that there are things that we can foresee in the future about\n",
      " prevention when it comes to viruses and workers in the workplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing I can tell you that the home care \n",
      "workers talked about is that they’re expected to take the mask and use \n",
      "it—like I said, one a day, right? And then they have to go into the \n",
      "office for gloves and hand sanitizers. They’re not brought to them, so \n",
      "they’ve got to go to the depot for the surgical masks, and then they’ve \n",
      "got to go to the head office of this care provider to get their gloves \n",
      "and their hand sanitizers—and they get as many as they want, so they \n",
      "said that was a good thing, so there are some positives there. But what \n",
      "they want to know is, “Why can’t we have a mask for each visit?”, \n",
      "because that was a better process for them. They felt that, number one, \n",
      "you don’t want to be spreading the virus from resident to resident when \n",
      "you’re in a home care situation, and you’re also very much going home \n",
      "after visiting people in home care, bringing it home to your family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have often talked about home care, and it’s \n",
      "another whole, big health care discussion that needs to be fixed, along \n",
      "with long-term care. I know that I’ve been on the long-term-care file \n",
      "for many years, and I’ve brought these issues many times, numerous \n",
      "times. I brought forward the public inquiry, in the election of 2018 at \n",
      "that point, when we had Wettlaufer, to expand it, and that was shot \n",
      "down. I don’t know why governments of the day don’t want to actually \n",
      "acknowledge what the real problems are and then just fix them. We’re all\n",
      " talking about how we shouldn’t be blaming any government. Well, then, \n",
      "you know what? Do the right thing, get the real problems on the table \n",
      "and then repair it, because then it doesn’t keep trickling down to the \n",
      "next government, where someone tinkers on a commission or tinkers on a \n",
      "committee. It doesn’t really get to the root of the problem, and then it\n",
      " passes on to the next government that’s in power and then everybody is \n",
      "to blame. Well, we can stop that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Premier said “hell or high water”—I think\n",
      " that was what it was. I can’t remember. Am I allowed to say that? I’ll \n",
      "change that: Heck or high water. Excuse me. I apologize. I was just \n",
      "quoting and not thinking of that. When he said that, the public inquiry,\n",
      " the independent, transparent public inquiry, where you can find the \n",
      "problem and fix the problem intermittently—it doesn’t mean you have to \n",
      "stop fixing the problems; that can be done, and that is something that \n",
      "we’ve been pushing for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I’m going back to the private members’ bill \n",
      "piece, how we are asking for Thursdays to be included in this whole \n",
      "debate. As the government House leader said, it doesn’t negate the \n",
      "ability of this Legislature to pass a private member’s bill. No, it does\n",
      " not, but the ones that are introduced are already there, and so, \n",
      "therefore, when you present a private member’s bill, you can only do it \n",
      "as an introduction. You can introduce a bill and that’s it. If we have \n",
      "Thursdays, we can actually debate it for the time that we are allowed as\n",
      " members to bring issues forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a bill, Bill 13, on the books, which is the\n",
      " Time to Care Act. The government is looking for solutions around \n",
      "long-term care and how to solve these problems. Well, the Time to Care \n",
      "Act gives you a solution to that. It’s not just myself and the member \n",
      "from Nickel Belt who have advocated for this; it’s also other \n",
      "stakeholders that have advocated for this. So if he is looking to \n",
      "balance out passing government bills to private members’ bills, I urge \n",
      "the government to pass my bill, Bill 13, the Time to Care bill, in that \n",
      "vein. We’ll see if that happens—but giving people enough advance notice \n",
      "in order to properly represent their constituents, I think, should be \n",
      "the professional standard in this Legislature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re all elected by our constituents in each one \n",
      "of our ridings. We all want to do the best job that we can. We all want \n",
      "to bring their voices and their problems to the Legislature, in a way \n",
      "that’s not sarcastic, in goodwill. I think we all do that. When we ask \n",
      "questions or when we bring stories forward in our debates, we’re all \n",
      "doing that. But if we’re not given the opportunity to, again, discuss \n",
      "these things, then it takes away that privilege that we do have. We’re \n",
      "all here on borrowed time. We don’t know what the next two years are \n",
      "going to bring, so we all want to do the best job possible. We all want \n",
      "to bring those strong legislative pieces that our constituents have \n",
      "endured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the legislation is feel-good legislation. \n",
      "They do good things. They’re promoting wonderful, positive things, like \n",
      "when we talk about certain heritage days or awareness days. And then \n",
      "there is other legislation with very, very heartfelt, horrible stories \n",
      "that push us to bring legislation forward in order to make real change. \n",
      "It could just affect one family that you have, but then all of a sudden \n",
      "you talk about this issue and you see that it’s widespread. And it’s not\n",
      " anyone in particular that owns that issue, because once you start \n",
      "bringing up a private member’s bill, as if we had the Thursdays, like we\n",
      " present in this motion, then what would happen is, you would actually \n",
      "get this back and forth and you’d hear it from other members on the \n",
      "government side, the independents, the opposition side. You would hear \n",
      "the commonalities of what is happening in other ridings that they can \n",
      "actually identify with and hopefully support, get to committee and pass \n",
      "one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have to say that the other three bills the \n",
      "government wants to quickly push through—I did look at the scheduling; \n",
      "maybe they know this, or maybe they don’t. They’ve got Bill 156, which, \n",
      "again, is a very important bill. It’s the biodiversity bill. In the \n",
      "context, again, of what we’re living through, the pandemic, there are \n",
      "many people who work in processing plants, right? You know that there \n",
      "are farmers worrying about the supply and demand and how that’s going to\n",
      " work. That is on June 8. Hearings are 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and then 1 \n",
      "p.m. to 6 p.m., and then so is building transit, Bill 171. That’s also \n",
      "10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on June 8, and then on June 9, \n",
      "they’ve got it again at the same times. Then there is an extra day under\n",
      " Bill 171, the transit bill, where—again, I’m not presuming this could \n",
      "be a conflict for anyone, but it’s a possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1410\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s where you have to—when you say, “This \n",
      "is what I’m offering you,” and then someone points out, “Well, perhaps \n",
      "this is something that can be changed because it could be a challenge.” \n",
      "You can have farmers who are interested in transit. You can have people \n",
      "who are in transit interested in the farming. You are going to end up \n",
      "having people decide, “Where do I want to go? Can I present on two? Am I\n",
      " able to with the scheduling?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, when we are in a coronavirus piece, yes, \n",
      "we’re all home, but there are parents who are home with their children \n",
      "and working, trying to juggle that. There are people home who took their\n",
      " families, their loved ones, out of long-term care to look after them. \n",
      "So they can’t just necessarily drop everything and plug in to those two \n",
      "days if they have an interest in either one, and that’s very plausible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to say, as much as the government House \n",
      "leader or the government wants to paint that picture, I would ask that \n",
      "they remember that the intentions of everyone in this Legislature are to\n",
      " bring their best foot forward to represent their constituents and to \n",
      "try to work within what their beliefs are, what their best decisions \n",
      "they feel will be able to help move things forward. It may not always be\n",
      " what you say, and you may want to do whatever you want to do. But \n",
      "giving the courtesy, the respect, the professional back and forth so \n",
      "that we would have known on Tuesday we were going to come in and debate \n",
      "the defibrillator bill, would have been good. You’re a majority \n",
      "government. You can do what you like. You can bring it forward, and no \n",
      "one takes that away from you. But it is helpful to us if we’re given \n",
      "that instead of catching people off guard: “Hah, we got you. Because you\n",
      " did this, I’m doing that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t see how that is helpful going forward. I \n",
      "don’t see how that is helpful, especially when we are supposed to be \n",
      "under this time, in a coronavirus situation, trying to work so that we \n",
      "can accomplish what we’re supposed to be doing for the people. They’re \n",
      "the ones that are depending on us to work together to come up with \n",
      "things that are going to prevent this from happening again. Nobody wants\n",
      " to see this occur again, and there are so many things that can be done,\n",
      " like I say, under Bill 175 that’s been put in the motion, that we could\n",
      " be doing differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest one of the things we should be doing \n",
      "differently is looking at, again, the not-for-profit home care piece. \n",
      "Under previous governments, a lot of privatization was implemented in \n",
      "health care, and it’s not a good model. All dollars that go into public \n",
      "health care should be for care, should be patient-centred. I heard the \n",
      "minister say that today, that it should be patient-centred. How you get \n",
      "care patient-centred is you make sure that all the money you put into \n",
      "public health care is used for care. That’s patient-centred, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having the government wanting to push this through\n",
      " the Legislature and, again, not even testing what a virtual committee \n",
      "composition would look like—that leaves a lot of questions: Are there \n",
      "going to be hiccups where people aren’t going to be able to get on? Is \n",
      "there going to be a problem because people can’t get on to present? Not \n",
      "everybody has the Internet throughout the whole province. Not everybody \n",
      "can get access to it. Is that going to be a concern? There are a lot of \n",

      "they have a right to do that—so do members who are elected in their \n",

      "person who has reasonable grounds to believe that there is an animal in \n",
      "critical distress in a motor vehicle may enter the motor vehicle for the\n",
      " purpose of relieving the animal from distress.’ But to date to our \n",

      "the early days of LED lighting, Rick took a real bold step and he \n",
      "invested in some new lighting. He had people come in on overtime on the \n",
      "weekend and put lighting all over the place. We literally showed up on \n",

      "Why? Because due to reasons that are not fully understood by her, her \n",

      "\n",
