      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " Ms. Khanjin has moved government notice of motion number 77. I’ve been \n",
      "advised that there is a typo in the motion. It should say “Thursday, \n",

      "The Deputy Clerk (Mr. Trevor Day): “Thursday, June 17.”\n",

      "Ms. Andrea Khanjin:\n",
      " Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As you see by this motion, when our government \n",
      "got elected, we hit the ground running to accomplish so much for \n",
      "Ontarians. When I was knocking on doors and talking to many of my \n",
      "constituents, they often said, “What does the government really do for \n",
      "us? How can they achieve progress? We see a lot of debate, we see a lot \n",
      "of bickering, and we see a lot of things in the debate. What about grand\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",

      "going to be dealt with—they will have heard the government House leader \n",
      "say that, given that we have never in this Legislature held virtual \n",
      "committee meetings before, we would do sort of a trial run, that we \n",
      "would bring forward a single, relatively non-contentious bill—for \n",
      "example, a bill like the Legislative Assembly Act, a bill that was dealt\n",
      " with rather quickly in this Legislature because there was widespread \n",

      "the five long-term-care homes that they were deployed to because of the \n",
      "coronavirus. What the Canadian Armed Forces uncovered was unspeakable. I\n",

      "feeling, how they are processing this information, and how they must be \n",
      "filled with worry and, quite frankly, disgust.\n",
      "Mr. Logan Kanapathi:\n",
      " Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Throughout these challenging times, we have \n",
      "all witnessed incredible acts of kindness, generosity and compassion in \n",
      "our communities.\n",
      "Mr. Guy Bourgouin:\n",
      " Small municipalities in the north face a devastating fiscal situation. \n",
      "While they all have limited fiscal capacity, small towns must face new \n",
      "COVID expenses and keep up with infrastructure that cannot be shut down.\n",
      " Moosonee, for example, continues to operate the main airport of the \n",
      "James Bay, in spite of having lost most revenues. They must keep the \n",
      "airport alive because they serve medical, flood, forecasting and cargo \n",
      "operations. Also, most northern municipalities have taken relief action.\n",
      " Hearst, for instance, paused a tax increase while facing a revenue loss\n",
      " of a quarter of a million dollars between mid-March and April. Other \n",
      "towns have waived interest and penalties, offered payment deferrals or \n",
      "service rebates to small businesses.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser:\n",
      " This pandemic has been hard on families across this province, \n",
      "especially families in long-term care, those families who have someone \n",
      "who is sick and being treated in hospital, and someone who is \n",
      "chronically ill. There’s some risk in this pandemic where we may lose \n",
      "something that’s really important, lose our humanity. One of the things \n",
      "we are at risk of losing is the role of essential family caregivers and \n",
      "the role that they play to keep their loved ones well: sometimes feed \n",
      "them, sometimes bathe them, sometimes avoid medical accidents, to ensure\n",
      " that they get the care that they need. Essential family caregivers are \n",
      "just that: They’re essential. They are not visitors.\n",
      "Mr. Amarjot Sandhu:\n",
      " From the onset of the outbreak of COVID-19, the government of Ontario \n",
      "has taken significant steps to curb the spread of this virus and to \n",
      "reduce its impacts on the health of Ontarians and our economy. During \n",
      "this time of crisis, volunteers and organizations from Brampton West and\n",
      " Brampton have rallied to provide support for vulnerable people in \n",

      "Muslim Jama’at, My Indians in Canada Association, care4cause, Punjabi \n",

      "up to ensure food can reach Bramptonians who need it the most.\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Members’ statements? The member for Scarborough Southwest.\n",
      "Mr. Vijay Thanigasalam:\n",
      " In the fight against COVID-19, the residents of Scarborough–Rouge Park \n",
      "have been more resilient than ever. I want to recognize the incredible \n",

      "Community Association, the Highland Creek Community Association, Muslim \n",

      " Since the beginning of the pandemic, people in my community of Oakville\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): That concludes our members’ statements for this morning.\n",
      "Ms. Peggy Sattler:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker. I rise on a point of order. Our lead questions are \n",
      "to the Premier, and the government has not confirmed whether the Premier\n",
      " will be attending today or not. I would ask if the government can let \n",
      "us know if he will be late, and if he will be, we would like a UC to \n",
      "stand down the lead—\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " That’s not a point of order. Again, I would remind the members that \n",
      "it’s a long-standing tradition of the House not to point out the absence\n",
      " of any member. I would suggest, especially at this time, we—but you \n",
      "were asking—\n",
      "Ms. Peggy Sattler: I seek a UC to stand down our lead until the Premier arrives.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " The member for London West is seeking unanimous content of the House to\n",
      " stand down the lead questions for the official opposition until the \n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " The government House leader is seeking unanimous consent to move a \n",
      "motion without notice respecting the voting procedure today. Agreed? I \n",
      "heard a no.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " My first question is to the Premier, whom people deserve to have \n",
      "sitting in his place answering questions today. Yesterday, the Canadian \n",
      "Armed Forces—\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " I’m going to interrupt the leader and remind all members of the House \n",
      "that it’s not appropriate to point out the absence of any member. Again,\n",
      " there’s a reason for it. It’s a long-standing tradition. From time to \n",
      "time, any of us might be away from the House, so it’s a courtesy to all \n",
      "members.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker. In these horrifying times, my first question this \n",
      "morning comes to the Premier. Yesterday, the Canadian Armed Forces \n",
      "presented a devastating report into the neglect and abuse of seniors in \n",
      "Ontario’s long-term-care homes. The report is heartbreaking and \n",
      "horrifying, especially for families and seniors in these homes. I spoke \n",
      "with some family members from Orchard Villa this morning, and they are \n",
      "devastated, not because they’re surprised but because it confirms the \n",
      "warnings that they had been screaming at this government for weeks.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott):\n",
      " Once again—and maybe this is the last time, I hope—I’m going to ask the\n",
      " members not to make reference to the absence of any other member.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker, and thank you for the important question. Our \n",
      "government is absolutely committed to transforming long-term care and \n",
      "health care. That is why, all this time, we’ve been transforming to \n",
      "Ontario health teams and to Ontario Health. We’ve taken the \n",
      "long-term-care sector very seriously, understanding the need for \n",
      "transformation. I spent almost 30 years as a family doctor, caring for \n",
      "people—our most vulnerable people—and understanding their needs. That’s \n",
      "what I came here to do.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question?\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Families who read devastating reports yesterday of ongoing abuse and \n",
      "institutional neglect deserve so much more from their government. \n",
      "Instead of acknowledging the role that the cuts and neglect played in \n",
      "creating this crisis, the Premier and his minister offered excuses. \n",
      "Instead of accountability, the Premier blocked plans for an inquiry and \n",
      "defended his team.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again to the opposition for that question. When you look at \n",
      "long-term care, as I have for decades, you understand that our most \n",
      "vulnerable people are in long-term care. The report was appalling; there\n",
      " is no question. How we respond to that now with an independent \n",
      "commission that allows the public to be heard, that allows for public \n",
      "hearings, that allows for a public report, is absolutely critical. Those\n",
      " voices need to be heard.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The final supplementary.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Speaker, a commission is not good enough. That was something that the \n",
      "women from the home that I spoke to this morning actually agreed with. \n",
      "They think a commission is the wrong way to go, and so do we.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again for the question. Long-term care was in crisis before \n",
      "COVID hit. Our government was committed, is committed and will be \n",
      "committed to the care of and compassion for our most vulnerable \n",
      "citizens. I rose in the chamber on March 12 to talk about how this is a \n",
      "time for caring and compassion; it is not a time for vitriol. I will say\n",
      " today that it is a time for finding solutions.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " My next question is also to the Premier. Look, if this was their number\n",
      " one commitment, they have failed miserably. They have failed miserably,\n",
      " and everybody knows it now. We all knew it before. We did here in this \n",
      "chamber, here on the opposition bench, because the previous government \n",
      "failed as well. But now everybody knows the failure in long-term care.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again for the important question. I have said many times that\n",
      " long-term-care homes were on the front lines of this battle with COVID.\n",
      " When you consider the report, it’s very clear that there was a war \n",
      "going on in our homes against COVID—and the fact that the military had \n",
      "to be called in to support these homes, and the staffing shortages that \n",
      "suddenly became magnified many times more when COVID came into the \n",
      "homes. It would spiral into an abyss very quickly, and that’s why the \n",
      "military was called in.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Speaker, the minister stood in this House and assured Ontarians back at\n",
      " the end of February that everything had been done, that they had a \n",
      "plan, that long-term care was going to be fine. And then the Premier \n",
      "talked about “the iron ring” around long-term care. They said they were \n",
      "going to spare no expense on long-term care—all of these empty words \n",
      "over and over and over again, for weeks and weeks and weeks, while \n",
      "family members and residents became more and more desperate.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you once again for the question. Our government has been \n",
      "committed, and you can see that from the very beginning of our \n",
      "government’s commitments. We look at the 15,000 beds that were to be \n",
      "developed and redeveloped. What we’re finding is the ward rooms, the \n",
      "lack of redevelopment, the lack of new space. Our hospitals were also at\n",
      " capacity with hallway health care. This was an entire system \n",
      "reorganization: Ontario Health, Ontario health teams, integrating \n",
      "long-term care into that process so that they could be more integrated \n",
      "with expertise involving infection control and also the expertise for \n",
      "our long-term-care homes so badly needed. Our personal support workers \n",
      "were short in supply. We asked the government to help us streamline that\n",
      " process to make that easier. The staffing crises, the capacity in our \n",
      "hospitals—it all needed addressing, and our government was working on \n",
      "that from the beginning.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Thank you. The final supplementary.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " In February 2019, the Ministry of Health conducted a resident quality \n",
      "inspection at the Altamont Care Community facility. They found that the \n",
      "facility failed to keep the home furnishings and equipment clean and \n",
      "sanitary, walls were covered in food stains, and residents with bedsores\n",
      " were not being properly treated. This resident quality inspection was \n",
      "one of only nine conducted in over 626 homes in Ontario. It was one of \n",
      "only nine inspected. The Premier scaled those inspections back \n",
      "dramatically after private long-term-care operators described those \n",
      "inspections as “red tape.”\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton: Thank you again. These homes were in crisis, and that’s why the military was called in.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Speaker, my next question is also to the Premier—the same Premier who \n",
      "cut funding to long-term care and virtually eliminated long-term-care \n",
      "inspections, who has no right at all at this point in time to be shocked\n",
      " by the state of long-term care, and no credibility whatsoever when he \n",
      "says he will investigate.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thanks for the question. I have to push back. I have to clarify. I have\n",
      " to tell the truth. And the truth absolutely is that the inspections \n",
      "were never stopped. We have done more inspections than ever before.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath: There’s something called facts.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Order.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton: —and I think it’s very important that we clarify, because reality matters. The truth matters.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Thank you very much. The supplementary question.\n",
      "Ms. Andrea Horwath:\n",
      " Well, I would say to the minister and to the Premier: Resident quality \n",
      "inspections matter. They matter. And to take them down to nine a year \n",
      "when we have 626 long-term care homes in Ontario is negligent. It is \n",
      "them not doing their duty as a government.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Members, please take their seats.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. Our government is committed, and that’s why\n",
      " it began with the redevelopment of our long-term-care system. It put \n",
      "almost $2 billion towards building capacity and redevelopment. They’re \n",
      "undergoing a staffing study to inform a comprehensive staffing strategy.\n",
      " We are addressing Justice Gillese’s report and the important work done \n",
      "by the Auditor General as well.\n",
      "Mr. Parm Gill:\n",
      " My question is to the Minister of Education. Parents, teachers and \n",
      "students in my riding of Milton are doing their best in these very \n",
      "difficult circumstances. They’re being flexible, they’re working hard \n",
      "and they’re being creative. I’ve heard from countless parents who find \n",
      "that their kids are best supported when their teachers conduct live \n",
      "classes. This includes Adriana, who says, “As a parent, I would love for\n",
      " my kids to get the live interaction with their classmates and teachers \n",
      "so they can be engaged and actually learning at this time.”\n",
      "Hon. Stephen Lecce:\n",
      " Thank you so the member from Milton for his question and his \n",
      "leadership. I want just to start with a recognition of gratitude to our \n",
      "educators, to our students and parents for rising to the challenge in \n",
      "this truly unprecedented time.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. Parm Gill:\n",
      " Thank you to the minister for the answer. In these difficult times, \n",
      "it’s more important than ever that our education system adapt to the \n",
      "needs of students. This is critical, especially when it comes to mental \n",
      "health. Anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges are on \n",
      "the rise, and tragically, our kids are not excluded from this.\n",
      "Hon. Stephen Lecce:\n",
      " Thank you again to the member for Milton for the question. I know that \n",
      "mental health is a priority for all members of the House, and I actually\n",
      " appreciate my conversations with the critics in all parties and the \n",
      "leader of the Green Party, discussing this very issue. It is why in part\n",
      " the Premier announced some weeks ago an additional $12-million \n",
      "investment to support mental health, to enable our young people to have \n",
      "the strength that they need through this difficulty.\n",
      "Ms. Teresa J. Armstrong:\n",
      " My question is to the Premier. The government spent months saying they \n",
      "were monitoring long-term care closely but yesterday claimed to know \n",
      "nothing of the horrific conditions in our long-term-care homes. The \n",
      "horrifying report from our armed forces comes after the government’s \n",
      "decision to virtually eliminate proactive resident quality inspections \n",
      "in long-term care. The government insisted that this would have no \n",
      "impact on care. In fact, last April, the minister claimed that Ontario \n",
      "has “the most rigorous” inspections “in Canada” and didn’t need resident\n",
      " quality inspections.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question from the opposition. Our government is \n",
      "absolutely committed to long-term care and reforming health care. In our\n",
      " long-term-care system, we are monitoring the homes. We are moving in \n",
      "the right direction. Our homes are improving. There are a handful of \n",
      "homes that have been under exceptional stress, largely due to staffing \n",
      "issues. We use certain criteria to identify red homes versus yellow \n",
      "homes versus green homes. We’ve been actively monitoring that all this \n",
      "way.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question: the member for Brampton Centre.\n",
      "Ms. Sara Singh:\n",
      " Speaker, it’s difficult to believe that this government had absolutely \n",
      "no idea about the crisis in long-term-care homes when conditions like \n",
      "the ones detailed in the Canadian Armed Forces report are happening \n",
      "across this province, including in cities like Brampton. The Premier \n",
      "said himself that he believes that there are also other homes that are \n",
      "impacted.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. In fact, there was a crisis in \n",
      "long-term-care homes. We knew that there was a shortage of personal \n",
      "support workers. That contributes greatly in a time of absolute crisis, \n",
      "like COVID-19.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser: My question is for the Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. We were actively monitoring these homes—as \n",
      "I’ve mentioned, red, yellow, green—homes that were particularly on the \n",
      "radar for staffing crises. We had been taking measures all along in \n",
      "terms of our emergency orders to understand and anticipate how \n",
      "government could move quickly.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser: I was hoping the minister would provide a more direct and specific answer as to when she knew.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " We have numerous eyes watching the homes and monitoring, and making \n",
      "sure that they’re in close contact with the homes, looking at the red, \n",
      "the yellow and the green. These homes were having difficulties; there \n",
      "was no doubt about that. As we called in the military—it takes time. \n",
      "That’s why I can’t give you a precise date.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser:\n",
      " My question again is for the Minister of Long-Term Care. Given the \n",
      "disturbing report from the Canadian military into the conditions in \n",
      "these five long-term-care homes—like these five homes, there are dozens \n",
      "of homes with double-digit deaths across this province. Given that the \n",
      "ministry’s most prominent response to the Gillese report was to only do \n",
      "resident quality inspections—full inspections—in nine out of 626 homes \n",
      "last year, Speaker, through you: How can the minister assure Ontarians \n",
      "that what was reported today isn’t happening in other homes in this \n",
      "province?\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " If you look at the devastating effect of COVID-19 on our homes that \n",
      "were already in crisis situations with staffing going into this \n",
      "pandemic, our government and my ministry were taking every measure \n",
      "possible to address that. We were looking at volunteer portals. The \n",
      "nursing associations were assisting with volunteers. We were looking \n",
      "everywhere for support, and our long-term-care homes need to be places \n",
      "where people want to work.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. John Fraser:\n",
      " Speaker, why did it take us a month to raise the wages of the \n",
      "lowest-paid workers in long-term care, like other provinces did? Why did\n",
      " we take a month not to have workers working in more than one home, to \n",
      "stop the spread of disease? Why did we wait months and months to give \n",
      "ourselves the power to take over long-term-care homes and then actually \n",
      "do it?\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. I share concern over our vulnerable people \n",
      "in society. Our government embarked on a transformation of care because \n",
      "it understood the need. Ontario health teams integrating long-term care \n",
      "into our acute care setting and into the community: These are absolutely\n",
      " critical pieces as we move forward.\n",
      "Ms. Marit Stiles:\n",
      " My question is to the Premier. Mr. Speaker, back even as the pandemic \n",
      "was just unfolding, sadly, many in the sector—some of us \n",
      "included—predicted that this was going to result in a massacre of the \n",
      "vulnerable and the old. I, for one, wish that that was not true, and I \n",
      "know we all do, but it has come to be.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Thank you.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " I appreciate the anger that you have, and I appreciate your \n",
      "frustration. I look back on the last few months, dealing with our \n",
      "long-term-care system in this COVID world we live in, and it is \n",
      "absolutely heart wrenching, gut wrenching. As a physician who spent 30 \n",
      "years not only looking after our vulnerable people but looking after \n",
      "members of my own family, to insinuate that I sat there and did nothing \n",
      "is absolutely incomprehensible to me when I know the truth; I know the \n",
      "reality. I know the commitment that our government has had. I know the \n",
      "commitment that I have had. That is why I am here, and that’s why we \n",
      "took every measure, every tool, all the emergency orders. Everything was\n",
      " on the table. We acted swiftly and decisively.\n",
      "Ms. Marit Stiles: Resign. Resign.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Order.\n",
      "Ms. Catherine Fife:\n",
      " To the Minister of Health: That answer, though, was not good enough for\n",
      " the people of the province. In Waterloo region, we’ve seen the painful \n",
      "fallout from declining standards in long-term care, like Revera’s Forest\n",
      " Heights home. Fifty residents—50—have died from COVID-19 in this home. \n",
      "Scared and angry families have reached out to myself and the MPP for \n",
      "Kitchener–Conestoga. Why? Because, before COVID-19, families were \n",
      "spending up to six hours a day caring for their loved ones. They knew \n",
      "that there were no minimum standards of care; they knew that the \n",
      "staffing ratios were poor; they knew that there were reduced in-person \n",
      "inspections. Families were holding this broken system together. The \n",
      "health minister was also Patient Ombudsman. She would have heard these \n",
      "serious concerns and the pain from these families. The pain and the \n",
      "suffering of these residents is not subject to cabinet confidentiality.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): To reply, the Minister of Health.\n",
      "Hon. Christine Elliott:\n",
      " As the Minister of Long-Term Care has stressed repeatedly today, we \n",
      "have taken this seriously from the very beginning, putting in place \n",
      "protections for people in long-term care, making sure that we had the \n",
      "personal protective equipment that they needed. It might not have been \n",
      "used by the management in some of these places, but the personal \n",
      "protective equipment was there.\n",
      "Mr. Jim Wilson:\n",
      " My question is for the Minister of Infrastructure. I am frequently \n",
      "contacted by constituents about the need for high-speed Internet in many\n",
      " areas of my riding. One recent email was from Essa township councillor \n",
      "Keith White, who’s concerned about a resident who may lose her Internet \n",
      "service. Like many residents, Keith wants to know what the province is \n",
      "doing about improving service, not removing it.\n",
      "Hon. Laurie Scott:\n",
      " Thank you to the member opposite for his question. While our government\n",
      " has been a steadfast funding partner for broadband projects in Ontario,\n",
      " like the Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology project, known as \n",
      "SWIFT, I’m sure the experienced member opposite knows that providing \n",
      "reliable and affordable broadband service is a responsibility of the \n",
      "federal government. With that being said, I have raised this issue on \n",
      "countless calls with the federal minister responsible, urging her \n",
      "government to join Ontario and our municipal and private sector partners\n",
      " in closing the digital divide that the COVID-19 epidemic has brought to\n",
      " the forefront.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The supplementary question.\n",
      "Mr. Jim Wilson:\n",
      " Thank you to the minister. I know that everyone in the House can agree \n",
      "that the need for high-speed Internet is only increasing during this \n",
      "time of the COVID-19 virus, because people are working from home and \n",
      "because of the e-platform for education.\n",
      "Hon. Laurie Scott: I thank you and I accept that challenge.\n",
      "Mr. Michael Mantha:\n",
      " My question is to the Premier. Ontarians know that these problems are \n",
      "not new. Just a few months ago, I sat here in my chair and looked at my \n",
      "leader when, along with my colleagues, we were accused of being \n",
      "fearmongers. Well, the fear is real, Mr. Speaker. Families have been \n",
      "hurting for years because of Liberal and Conservative inaction.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The Minister of Long-Term Care to reply.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. When I look at long-term care in \n",
      "Ontario—you have probably heard me say that Justice Gillese said it was a\n",
      " system that was strained. COVID-19 came along and broke it.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Supplementary question, the member for Mushkegowuk–James Bay.\n",
      "Mr. Guy Bourgouin:\n",
      " The previous government and this one have been slow to fix the problems\n",
      " with long-term care. Back in 2017, the Auditor General found that the \n",
      "government cut its inspections after it did a cost-benefit analysis of \n",
      "them and found inspections to be too expensive. That change in \n",
      "inspections resulted in a backlog of over 3,000 complaints and critical \n",
      "incidents. This government kept the new system, which has meant the \n",
      "quality of inspections of Ontario’s long-term-care facilities has \n",
      "dropped.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. Issues surrounding inspections have been \n",
      "raised from the beginning of this pandemic. We have multiple types of \n",
      "inspections. We conducted almost 3,000 inspections, as well as \n",
      "inspections of the homes every year.\n",
      "Ms. Judith Monteith-Farrell:\n",
      " My question is for the Premier. Experts have been sounding the alarm on\n",
      " the crisis in long-term care for decades. The Premier cannot pretend \n",
      "that this is the first he’s hearing of it or that he’s shocked, because \n",
      "workers represented by SEIU sent out a cry for help to the government \n",
      "and several times since, asking the government to step up and ramp up \n",
      "and care when private operators turned them away. Just in January 2020, \n",
      "Unifor commissioned the Ontario Health Coalition to produce a detailed \n",
      "report called Caring in Crisis, which they gave to the government. \n",
      "Workers have been alerting the government for years about this \n",
      "situation.\n",
      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. I do value all these questions. I think \n",
      "they are important times to address the stress and strain that long-term\n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): The member for Toronto Centre.\n",
      "Ms. Suze Morrison:\n",
      " Thank you, Speaker. Both the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario \n",
      "and the Ontario Nurses’ Association have been telling the Minister of \n",
      "Long-Term Care and the Minister of Health about the kind of conditions \n",
      "detailed in the CAF report for years now. They both say that they begged\n",
      " for this government to improve staffing and funding in long-term care. \n",
      "The ONA even said that after calling in the Ministry of Labour to try \n",
      "and fix things, they’ve also had to take this government and some \n",

      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. We have been listening and taking action. \n",
      "When we look at the long-term-care homes, every operator and every home \n",

      " My question is for the Minister of Long-Term Care. Yesterday’s Canadian\n",
      " Armed Forces report on those five long-term-care residences is very \n",
      "alarming. We cannot tell ourselves that these are five isolated cases.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for raising that. We have heard from you and others. That’s \n",

      "Seniors have been living in these horrible situations for too long now.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you again for the question. We’ve taken decisive actions over the\n",
      " last months with many ministries, in collaboration with the experts. We\n",
      " are doing that now, and we will continue to do that. This requires \n",
      "investigation, inspections that will require a lens to be put on this to\n",
      " understand how we move forward from this. It’s the infection control. \n",
      "It’s shoring up staffing. It’s making sure that everyone involved is \n",
      "accountable and responsible. I cannot be accountable for COVID, but I do\n",
      " take ownership of what is happening, and it’s incredibly important that\n",
      " we take ownership, that we solve these issues.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennifer (Jennie) Stevens:\n",
      " This is to the Premier. Long-term care is a serious issue for our \n",
      "veterans. The Royal Canadian Legion Ontario Command has been one of the \n",
      "louder voices to this government demanding a public inquiry into \n",
      "long-term care—on deaf ears. Now the long-term-care crisis is also \n",
      "affecting our Canadian Armed Forces members currently deployed in \n",
      "Ontario—35 members and counting. Not only have military personnel \n",
      "contracted the deadly COVID-19 while rescuing Ontario’s broken \n",
      "long-term-care system; now military sources have told reporters that \n",

      "The Speaker (Hon. Ted Arnott): Minister of Long-Term Care.\n",
      "Hon. Merrilee Fullerton:\n",
      " Thank you for the question. My heart goes out. I have great gratitude \n",
      "for the armed forces that have come in to support our homes. It was in \n",
      "our time of need, Ontario’s time of need, and they were there. I’ve said\n",
      " before: We are in a war against COVID-19. We are in a state of \n",

When I was knocking on doors and talking to many of my \\nconstituents, they often said, “What does the government really do for \\nus? How can they achieve progress? We see a lot of debate, we see a lot \\nof bickering, and we see a lot of things in the debate. What about grand\\n achievements and really delivering on promises?”',\n",
       " 'You often heard from us, “Promises made, promises \\nkept,” and that comes with great feedback. I know that the residents of \\nBarrie–Innisfil, especially during this time of COVID-19, have really \\npraised this government for some of the economic achievements we have \\nachieved, because we’re in a better position to weather the storm.',\n",
       " 'Of course this is a health pandemic—and I want to,\\n of course, thank all the front-line workers for all their efforts, \\nwhether it be Stevenson Memorial or whether it be Royal Victoria \\nHospital or Southlake—all hospitals that are very close to my riding. \\nThey’ve been doing incredible work. I just think of a lot of the \\nretirement homes and long-term-care homes with a lot of their nurses and\\n their PSWs who are doing so much work.',\n",
       " 'It’s one of the reasons that, on personal support \\nworker appreciation day locally, I had launched a recognition award for \\nthe community to get involved, where they can nominate their \\nlocal—whether it’s a nurse or whether it’s a personal support worker—to \\nnominate to recognize them for what they’re doing today, because they’re\\n working really hard. We need to respect that and do our part as well, \\nand to keep plugging away and working through the summer. We really owe \\nit to all Ontarians. We owe it to those who are keeping us safe and we \\nowe it to the taxpaying residents of this province.',\n",
       " 'When you talk to nurses who are working day in and\\n day out—we’re talking about sitting for a few hours a day, not even \\ngoing into midnight, not even going to 4 a.m. But some of these \\nnurses—and I want to thank many of them. One of them is a good friend of\\n mine, Andrea Logan. She has been working, day in and day out, at Royal \\nVictoria hospital on a lot of the shifts. She has been on different \\nfloors doing testing and what have you. I wanted to take this \\nopportunity to also thank her for all her efforts.',\n",
       " 'She is a single mom and she has a 12-year-old son.\\n You can only think of the challenges that she has had to overcome, like\\n finding daycare. Of course, that’s something our government also took \\naction on: providing daycare for our emergency workers and individuals \\nlike her, so that she can have someone take care of her son. So that’s \\nwonderful to see.',\n",
       " 'I would be remiss if I didn’t mention our \\nparamedics, because it’s paramedics’ week. Certainly, they’re working \\nday in and day out, and they look to their parliamentarians to respect \\nthe breadth of democracy and those who came before us, who fought in \\nWorld War I and World War II so we can have the freedoms that we uphold \\nwithin this Legislature, to debate and to have that discussion, which is\\n another reason why this motion is so important.',\n",
       " 'Going back to paramedics’ week and how important \\nit is to recognize those paramedics: When you do call and you need \\nsomeone to help, they’re often the first ones to the scene, and they’re \\nthere to help you during challenging times. I know that when you do make\\n that phone call, you’re in a very vulnerable situation. They are calm, \\ncollected and they are really out there.',\n",
       " 'They’ve always done a lot in the community. I \\nknow, back home in the Simcoe county area, every summer they do the \\nstretcher race. I know that the minister for women and children did that\\n stretcher race with me last summer. We would take turns riding the \\nstretcher. They are all pushing the stretcher. They’re not just doing it\\n for publicity; they’re doing it for the community, for fundraising. \\nThey did it to raise money for a cath lab, to save lives at Royal \\nVictoria hospital. If you are a heart patient, we know that time is \\nmuscle, and that the sooner you can get that heart patient to the \\nhospital, the quicker you can save their life. So they went out on this \\nvery hot day—I would say that it’s very much like the day we have \\ntoday—and they were just pushing the stretcher, and here I was, lying in\\n it.',\n",
       " 'So I want to thank all the Simcoe county \\nparamedics, of course, for all of the work they’ve been doing every \\nyear, day in and day out. They don’t take Christmas off. They don’t take\\n Thanksgiving off. They’re always there. They don’t take summers off \\neither. Again, we owe it to them to do our work as best as we can to \\nuphold democracy, just as they do in the health care field, upholding \\ntheir medical obligations and being out there to save lives.',\n",
       " 'On the topic of saving lives, we had, yesterday, a\\n grand achievement within this Legislature. My colleague from \\nEglinton–Lawrence tabled a bill that does that very thing: save lives \\nfor those who may need access to a defibrillator. There are many public \\nareas that don’t have a defibrillator.',\n",
       " 'I think of, back home in Barrie—we have a very \\ntragic story: Chase McEachern. He was a young hockey player and he \\nneeded a defibrillator, but it was not there in time. So his parents—it \\nwas a challenging time for them, of course, to mourn the loss of their \\nyoung son—wanted to do something about it to prevent other moms and dads\\n to see that happen to their children. So many hockey arenas now have a \\ndefibrillator. But that same opportunity and possibility to save lives \\nthat is in our hockey arenas today isn’t in all public areas. For that \\nfamily, the Chase McEachern family in Barrie, it means so much to them.',\n",
       " 'I wanted to thank the member from \\nEglinton–Lawrence for her ability to get this bill forward and pass it, \\nand work with so many people. We worked with members of the opposition \\non it as well, and there was support from all around. It really shows \\nyou what can be accomplished in this Legislature when we do work \\ntogether. And hey, we’ve got all summer now to work together, so there’s\\n a lot of things to look forward to.',\n",
       " 'Again, when we talk about our member, she has been\\n working really hard on that private member’s bill, so it’s good to see \\nit achieved. The fact that it is going to be saving lives across the \\nprovince—and that we can look back and say that during this pandemic, \\nyes, the government and the entire Legislature unanimously agreed on \\nmotions like the emergency orders motions. We worked together on that. \\nProtecting workers: We came back and did that.',\n",
       " '0930',\n",
       " 'But it shouldn’t just stop there; we need to keep \\ngoing. There’s a lot more business that we need to have happen within \\nthis Legislature to bring progress to Ontario, because when you think \\nabout it, yes, there is a health care pandemic, but there are huge \\neconomic consequences. For the first time, I’ve heard a lot of \\nindividuals from all different walks and parties actually talk about \\nbusinesses and the struggles they are going through. We have that \\ncommonality here in the Legislature, wanting to help small businesses, \\nwhich is great because, as we know, they are the creators of the mass \\nmajority of jobs in our ridings.',\n",
       " 'You just take a drive in anyone’s riding, whether \\nyou’re in Kenora or you’re in Barrie or you’re in Muskoka or \\nEglinton–Lawrence or Markham–Stouffville: You see these businesses and \\ntheir empty parking lots. They’re empty. Finally they’re coming back, \\nbut now that they are able to open their doors, if they have a \\nstreet-front entrance, they are able to work, so why can’t they expect \\nthe same of their elected members? Which is why we are here—to really \\nstand up for them and get things moving.',\n",
       " 'We talk about the supply chain. One of the things \\nin this motion is talking very much about the supply chain when it comes\\n to our agriculture sector. I know that in Innisfil—it’s not a surprise;\\n it’s a statistic all around the world: We have more chickens than \\npeople. The agriculture sector there is certainly thriving. There’s not \\ngoing to be a takeover any time soon, I’m hoping, but it is certainly \\nthriving. We have a lot of dairy farmers, and certainly we’ve seen the \\nimpacts of dairy within this pandemic, of course.',\n",
       " 'I know that our Minister of Agriculture, Food and \\nRural Affairs—I’ve been on several phone calls and Zoom meetings with \\nhim and with my local agricultural workers. These folks don’t get \\nthanked enough, so I want to thank all the agri-food workers, those \\nworking at food processing plants, and our farmers. You’ve really \\nstepped up to the plate for this pandemic. I’ve seen countless stories \\nof food bank donations. I know that our colleague from Mississauga has \\nbeen working with Sobeys to deliver food. We’re calling him our new Uber\\n Eats politician because he’s bringing food to all communities. In fact,\\n in my own community, Nutrafarms is a place that provides local meats. \\nThey were able to donate some of their local meats to his efforts to \\ndeliver to families. Likewise, we are working with some local onion \\nfarmers to get some onions to make some recipes that he’ll be delivering\\n to residents. So you really see how important that food supply chain \\nis.',\n",
       " 'We need to address some of the red tape that \\nhappens within that food supply chain, and I certainly heard a lot of \\nthat through folks in my riding and a lot of farmers, and that’s why one\\n of the things we will be debating this summer has to do with just that:\\n with our agricultural sector and being able to get at some of the red \\ntape that exists within the ag sector, but also to protect our farmers \\nand protect the livestock. I think that a lot of us talk about \\nbiosecurity. That’s so important, and that is certainly something we’re \\ngoing to be doing.',\n",
       " 'The other thing we talk about is how we actually \\ntransport those goods. We’ve got our member from Mississauga, who is \\ngetting in his car and delivering the food, but you need proper roads \\nand you need proper bridges to get those supplies to market. When it \\ncomes to infrastructure and transit development of any kind, that is \\njust so important to the entire supply chain, so of course it’s a very \\nbig priority. It’s something we embarked on as a province. It’s \\ncertainly a challenge, especially when we think about the Toronto \\nTransit Commission and being able to fix some of that movement of \\npeople. You can say that that is the service sector, getting people from\\n point A to point B to their jobs, to their loved ones, and to get those\\n support workers to their destination if that’s the method of \\ntransportation they are using. They rely on and expect that when they \\nare working really hard day and night and working those night shifts, \\nthey have proper transit that gets them to where they need to go. It’s \\none of the things we’ll be debating again this summer and will be \\nworking on, because a lot of those individuals are working and they rely\\n on us to do the same.',\n",
       " 'So, again, tying this back to the motion at hand, \\nand thanking all those—something that hasn’t been mentioned a lot, but I\\n know that our Minister of Transportation, our Associate Minister of \\nTransportation, and our workers who are getting us from—the GO train \\ndrivers are still operating. The GO train, the GO bus drivers and the \\nToronto Transit Commission drivers, whether they’re driving the subway \\nor the streetcar—all the stuff that they’re doing. The maintenance crew \\nthat are behind all of those efforts—to thank them, because they’re \\nworking through this whole pandemic. If there is a call for something \\nthat needs to be repaired, no matter what time of day it is, they’re \\nthere.',\n",
       " 'Likewise, as parliamentarians, we owe it to them, \\ntoo, to be here and to be able to work throughout the summer on \\naccomplishments for taxpaying residents of Ontario and all Ontarians. \\nIt’s so vital. But I did want to also take that moment to thank those \\nworkers because they’re out there, getting many residents to where they \\nneed to be, and doing it safely. We’ve seen many examples around the \\nworld of how you can use public transit safely. Certainly, all of them \\nare washing their hands or they’re wearing gloves. We’ve heard a lot \\nabout, if you are in confined spaces, to wear a mask, and some of those \\nthings that you have to do.',\n",
       " 'On the topic of masks, it’s incredible to see how \\nmany people in our communities—I’m sure that all of you have examples of\\n the families that step up to make these homemade masks. I know that the\\n Richardson family—Jennifer Richardson’s husband has been at his sewer \\nthis whole time, making handmade masks for everyone in Barrie–Innisfil. I\\n have picked up several masks from him for myself—I have one today with \\nme. Certainly, I wear that when I need to wear it, but I have also been \\nable to pick up masks for our senior communities that are in independent\\n living and in their homes, and they may need those things. They’ve \\nreally stepped up to the plate to make those masks. Certainly, we’ve \\nseen many other individuals throughout the riding who have been making \\nthose masks.',\n",
       " 'I know that as I look around to my colleagues, as \\nthey were walking in here today some had their masks on. A lot of them \\nwere also made in their ridings—homemade. Some of them have personal \\ntouches and different colours; that’s really nice to see. But that’s the\\n positive side of things. I think there is a lot of negativity out \\nthere. There is a lot of anxiety and stress. We have to hold on to those\\n really positive stories in our community and thank the individuals for \\nstepping up when it comes to this pandemic.',\n",
       " 'A lot of them who may be at home—they don’t have \\nthe ability to have a job. Maybe they have applied for the Canadian \\nemergency relief benefit or other things. At least they know that, with \\nthe job protection legislation that we passed in this Legislature \\nunanimously with support by all parties, they will still have a job to \\ngo to. But all of us also owe it to those individuals. We’re so \\nfortunate to represent the people of Ontario. We have to ensure that we \\nare here, working and passing legislation that will affect them \\nfirst-hand because, coming out of this pandemic, it’s going to be all \\nhands on deck as to how we get the economy rolling again.',\n",
       " 'I know that the Premier has committed to never \\nbeing reliant on other countries or being vulnerable to not be able to \\nsecure personal protection equipment. That’s a huge economic opportunity\\n in our province. We just saw yesterday—we’ve got the member for Whitby \\nhere. The General Motors plant is going to be making a lot of masks, \\nwhich is incredible. That is a made-in-Canada and made-in-Ontario \\nsolution to this huge problem. But think about the jobs it’s going to \\ncreate for the member for Whitby and those workers that can go back to \\nwork.',\n",
       " 'Our Minister of Finance has launched these jobs \\nand recovery committees. I’ve had several already. One thing I had \\nmentioned on the jobs and recovery committee is, when it comes to the \\nauto sector and what they’re doing, they test their workers every day. \\nThey’re screening them. And they can call in; if they have any symptoms,\\n they don’t have to go in to work. All these things are happening to \\nprotect our workers.',\n",
       " 'When we came together in this House to pass that \\nbill, it was great because it really complemented a lot of those efforts\\n that they’re doing right now within the other sectors of our economy \\nthat are so vital to keep things rolling and to keep things going. \\nThat’s going to be so critical after this, as we get through this \\ntogether and as we turn our minds to what the Ontario economy looks \\nlike.',\n",
       " 'A lot of the things that are in the motion that we\\n are debating today are very much a part of that: rolling the economy \\nand being able to say, “Within the ag sector, what are we doing to \\nprotect the supply chain, to protect our livestock and to protect our \\nfarmers? But also, how do we get people moving with transit, and \\nthanking all those transit workers?”',\n",
       " 'When it comes to community care and community \\nmedicine, we’ve seen how important it is. I’ve seen it.

       " 'Sandycove Acres is known to be the community of \\ngolf carts, and yes, they get around the community in their golf carts. \\nTheir most famous event is their Canada Day parade, where they all \\ndecorate their golf carts and go out and parade, and I’m in there and my\\n fellow member of Parliament is there. Unfortunately, it won’t be \\nhappening like it normally does this year, but we’ll find an alternative\\n way to make it happen safely.',\n",
       " '0940',\n",
       " 'But what did those members of Sandycove Acres do \\nto help this pandemic? There were these ladies that lunch who get \\ntogether, a group of seniors who get together, and they do fundraisers. \\nThe Barrie women’s shelter often relies on many donations. They receive \\nsome government funding, both federally and provincially, and through \\nthe county. But these ladies couldn’t get together to physically lunch \\nbecause they wanted to be safe, of course—they’re part of the more \\nvulnerable population—so they went online. They took to Facebook instead\\n of all getting together for lunch, and they asked everyone to put in \\n$10. Their goal was to raise about $1,000, and they exceeded that goal. \\nThey were able to get a cheque from the Sandycove Acres ladies that \\nlunch group and send it to the Barrie women’s shelter. Where there is a \\nwill, there is a way, Mr. Speaker.',\n",
       " 'Here, too, this government has a will to work and \\nhelp all Ontarians, as I know all members of the House have a will to do\\n that, because we do come here every so often to extend the emergency \\norders, and we do come back here to have question period and to have \\nthat democratic debate—so, so important. It makes me think of all those \\nother efforts we have throughout our ridings with people who constantly \\nwork and put those efforts in.',\n",
       " 'But I just wanted to mention some of those things \\nand just remind people why we’re here, and really kind of reach—this is \\nreally formidable for all of us in our ridings. No one could predict \\nthis was going to happen. All of us owe it to really step up and do what\\n we can to help our communities, like I was saying earlier, whether it’s\\n delivering groceries or I know many of our members have been out there \\ndelivering personal protective equipment to local residents. I know that\\n care kits have also been delivered, a lot of that, and just those \\nfeel-good efforts so that we can really get through this with kindness \\nand positivity and not negativity.',\n",
       " 'Ms. Andrea Khanjin:\\n Thank you to the member opposite, but they’re just examples to show you\\n that while people are working and doing all these efforts in all of our\\n communities, we also owe it to them to be here and to be working on \\nthose efforts.',\n",
       " 'Some of the bills that I had mentioned in the \\nmotion that we will be debating have first-hand impacts on local \\nmembers. I know we had another member, from Etobicoke–Lakeshore, come to\\n Innisfil, to the Harry Eisses farm, where biosecurity is really \\nimportant to them. So passing the biosecurity is so important.',\n",
       " 'We saw first-hand what Harry Eisses does, where, \\nbefore you walk in to see where the egg production is made and all of \\nthat is done, you’ve got to put on layers: You’ve got to cover your \\nshoes; you’ve got to cover your clothes; you’ve got to wear a hairnet, \\ngloves, everything. Think about what’s happening now. Everyone is \\nwearing gloves and covering their face and whatnot. But that’s their \\nday-to-day. That’s how they protect their chickens to make sure that \\nthere is no infection that happens there.',\n",
       " 'Certainly, we were able to walk through and see \\nhow amazing his operation was, and, more importantly, how important this\\n bill is going to be to him, because for him, that’s his livelihood. If \\nthere is some sort of infection or some sort of outbreak at his chicken \\nfarm, that’s his livelihood. But also, just from a caring perspective, \\nthose are animals that you don’t want to see hurt. You don’t want to see\\n them ill, just like you don’t want to see a human ill. Certainly, \\nthat’s something that he cares about. You have a lot of cattle \\nfarmers—same thing. They don’t want to see their cattle ill because \\nsomeone has marched onto their property, trespassing illegally, not \\nallowed, and suddenly you have an outbreak there.',\n",
       " 'I think, now more than ever, this is so relevant \\nand so important because we’ve seen what has happened with the outbreaks\\n in our community with COVID-19, but you imagine what the other side of \\nthings are, what happens in our agri-food sector, that you don’t want \\nthat happening. That is our food supply.',\n",
       " 'I know right now—he normally has this part of his \\nfarm where you can go in. He calls it the vending machine for eggs, but \\nreally it’s just that you take the eggs you want to buy and you drop off\\n the money. It’s the honour system. There’s a little till there to make \\nchange if you need change, and you pick up your eggs. But right now, \\nduring this pandemic, that area is closed. Again, he wants to protect \\nhis livelihood but also the chickens so that there’s no outbreak or \\nanything amongst his workers or amongst the chickens there. There are \\nactually pylons when you drive by; there are lots of pylons.',\n",
       " 'I’ve had many residents ask me when they are going\\n to open, because they want their fresh eggs. Unfortunately, I can’t \\nreally give them much of a reply because we have to take safety and \\nhealth—utmost importance. Certainly, that takes precedence, but it shows\\n you why our supply chain and the agri-food bill that we will be \\ndebating this summer are so important.',\n",
       " 'When I talked about the Minister of Agriculture—he\\n actually came to Innisfil, and we did a round table with farmers about \\nthe bill. You had grain farmers and you had livestock farmers etc., and \\nthey said that this was needed years ago. They’re finally excited that a\\n government is actually moving through with it. So that’s very good to \\nhear.',\n",
       " 'I know that the member for Eglinton–Lawrence—of \\ncourse, transit is very important to a lot of members. Another thing \\nwe’ll be talking about this summer is really getting people moving. We \\nowe it to Ontarians to have a state-of-the-art transit system. Frankly, \\nwhen we all travel—when we were allowed to travel before COVID-19—if you\\n compare Ontario to other areas, again, you talk about movement of \\ngoods, but you also talk about the service sector and movement of \\npeople. That has to be seamless. That’s going to have a huge impact on \\nour economy. If we can get that right, that has a direct impact on our \\neconomy, and we need that more than ever coming out of COVID-19 because \\nof all the things that are linked to transit projects. That’s a lot of \\njobs, job creation—the entire supply chain.',\n",
       " 'Near my riding I have Decast. It’s just outside \\nthe riding. They actually make all the molding for the subways. They’re \\nready. They said, “It’s great. You guys, when you’re getting this \\nbetter, faster transit stuff through”—they’ll want to come to the helm \\nto help. It’s local pride for a lot of people, but that’s jobs.',\n",
       " 'They do have a few jobs open now. They’re still \\ngoing and they’re still working—working safely. Certainly, if there’s \\nanyone watching at home who is looking for job opportunities, there are \\nlots out there. I’ve seen a lot of “help wanted” signs. Those economic \\nopportunities exist out there.',\n",
       " 'We, as a government, have the opportunity to make \\neven more economic opportunities coming out of this pandemic, and that \\nis through a lot of this legislation that we’re going to be debating \\nhere over the summer. I want to thank everyone for their time. I look \\nforward to seeing you in the summer and having more progress.']"

       " ['Now, I do understand that there’s going to be a \\nvirtual process. We don’t have any information on what that’s going to \\nlook like, what the requirements will be for presenters to participate \\nin that virtual process because, as I pointed out earlier this morning, \\nthe virtual process has never been tried before. We are going to be \\nrunning four virtual processes almost simultaneously on four very \\nsubstantive and, frankly, contentious pieces of legislation, and that’s a\\n problem.'],\n",
       " ['With that, I would like to move an amendment to the motion.'],\n",
       " ['I move that the motion be amended by striking out \\n“Tuesdays and Wednesdays” in the second paragraph and replacing it with \\n“Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays”; and'],\n",
       " ['By striking out “Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays”\\n in the third paragraph and replacing it with “Mondays, Tuesdays, \\nWednesdays and Thursdays”; and'],\n",

       " ['\\n Yes. Thank you very much, Speaker. This amendment, I think, \\ndemonstrates the official opposition’s commitment to working on behalf \\nof the people of this province. We not only want to be here two days a \\nweek in June; we want to be here three days a week. We want to be here \\nTuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. In July, we don’t just want to be \\nhere three days a week; we want to be here four days a week. We want to \\nwork on behalf of the people of this province.'],\n",
       " ['The amendment that I have proposed, by including \\nThursdays in both June and July, will enable the consideration of \\nprivate members’ motions and private members’ bills. As I have already \\npointed out in my remarks, these are important opportunities. Private \\nmembers’ public business is fundamental to the democratic process. It \\nreflects our rights, our privileges, our obligations as representatives \\nof the people who elected us to come to this place. We know that many \\nprivate members’ bills or private members’ motions originate from an \\nissue that we have learned about in our riding. They originate from a \\nconstituent who has brought our attention to a gap or a problem that can\\n be fixed through legislation. That, Speaker, is the logic behind the \\nfirst two parts of the amendment. We want to work. We want to work hard \\non behalf of the people we represent and work hard on behalf of the \\npeople in this province.'],\n",
       " ['The third part of the amendment calls for the \\ndeletion of the four bills that are identified in this motion. We \\nbelieve that now is the time for this Legislature to be looking at \\nlegislation that addresses COVID-19-related issues. We had a consensus. \\nWe had an agreement among all the parties that that was going to be our \\nfocus, that this is what we were going to be doing as the Legislature \\nresumed. So to see a motion that doesn’t provide any opportunity for \\nconsideration of COVID-19-related bills, that simply rams through some \\nleftover items of this government’s agenda—an agenda, frankly, that has \\nfailed the people of this province, an agenda that cut millions of \\ndollars from public health, compromised our ability to respond to this \\npandemic, an agenda that eliminated inspections in long-term-care \\nhomes—this is the kind of agenda that this government is narrowly \\nfocused on pushing through, and that’s a problem for us.'],\n",
       " ['1330'],\n",
       " ['We want to be here. We want to be talking about \\nthe priorities that we’re hearing about in our communities. We look \\nforward to working with this government on legislation that’s going to \\naddress those priorities.'],\n",
       " ['We would hope that the government would be \\ninterested in hearing from us, hearing our views on actions that could \\nbe taken to support Ontarians who are struggling with the impact of \\nCOVID-19; for example, a commercial rent subsidy. That is something that\\n we would be very interested in working with the government on. We know \\nthat they believe the program that they’ve put in place is just \\ngreat—“Let’s not rush to judgment on it. Let’s see how it’s working.” \\nWell, we know it is not working. All of us have been hearing from \\nbusinesses in our communities that they can’t stay afloat and cannot see\\n a way to survive to the end of this pandemic. They are facing huge \\nfixed costs, of rent that has to continue to be paid, of utilities that \\nhave to continue to be paid. In my riding of London West, many of them \\ndon’t have enough staff that would qualify them to apply for the federal\\n wage subsidy. They’re not getting anything. They have landlords who \\ndon’t want to participate in the commercial rent program. They are \\ndesperate. I know that we have all heard those stories of desperate \\nbusinesses. That is something we could be talking about on a Thursday in\\n private members’ public business—about bringing in some meaningful rent\\n relief for businesses in this province so that they don’t go under, so \\nthat we still have an economy to return to once we get through this \\npandemic.'],\n",
       " ['We could also be talking about the implementation \\nof some of those fixes in long-term care that need to be taken now. We \\nhave been very clear that a public inquiry does not mean putting off \\ndecisions about changes that need to be made until the inquiry is \\nreported a couple of years down the road—an independent, transparent, \\nfully public inquiry, under the Public Inquiries Act—that can identify \\nright away the changes that need to be made now, the legislative changes\\n that might need to be implemented to support it. That legislation could\\n be brought in over June and July. We could move quickly to address some\\n of the appalling abuses of our seniors in the five long-term-care homes\\n that were supported by the military. Unfortunately, I don’t think any \\nof us believe that there were only five. Unfortunately, there were only \\nfive that the military went into. It is very, very concerning to think \\nabout the conditions that our frail elderly are living in in those other\\n 257 long-term-care homes that the military didn’t go into.'],\n",
       " ['Speaker, these are the opportunities we have \\nbefore us to be nimble, to be responsive, to really address the \\npriorities that people in this province have identified, the things that\\n they want all of us to be working together on, and to bring in \\nlegislation initiatives to deal with those things.'],\n",
       " ['I have not received a single email from somebody \\nwho wants to know, “When will Bill 171 go forward on the public agenda?”\\n “When will Bill 175”—Bill 175, again, is the home care act. If \\nanything, I have received emails from people who are very concerned \\nabout home care. They do not see Bill 175 as the solution.'],\n",
       " ['I heard from vulnerable people who were receiving \\nservices from a PSW. The private agency that the PSW worked for was not \\nrequiring that PSW to wear PPE when they went in to support that \\nconstituent. Meanwhile, that PSW may have been going into 20 different \\nhomes in a week and all the while not wearing masks, not wearing gloves \\nand exposing very, very vulnerable people to potential COVID-19 \\ninfection. I don’t fault the PSW. The PSW was absolutely working under \\nthe rules that the private sector agency had established, and that PSW \\nwas failed by those rules. Those vulnerable constituents were failed by \\nthe lack of protection for that worker and for themselves.'],\n",
       " ['Speaker, I would love to be looking at paid sick \\ndays. We saw the Premiers of BC, Manitoba and Yukon release a statement \\nabout how excited they were about working with the federal government to\\n implement those 10 paid sick days. We haven’t heard a thing from this \\ngovernment about when workers in this province are going to be protected\\n with paid sick days. In fact, they say that that’s politicizing, that \\nit’s being political, asking when Ontario workers can expect to see paid\\n sick days. That’s not political; that is good public policy. That is \\nwhat workers in this province need and expect from us.'],\n",
